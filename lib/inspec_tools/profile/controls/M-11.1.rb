4.6 Ensure VM disks for critical VMs are encrypted with Customer-
Supplied Encryption Keys (CSEK) (Scored)"
  desc  "Customer-Supplied Encryption Keys (CSEK) are a feature in Google Cloud
Storage and
    Google Compute Engine. If you supply your own encryption keys, Google uses
your key to
    protect the Google-generated keys used to encrypt and decrypt your data. By
default,
    Google Compute Engine encrypts all data at rest. Compute Engine handles and
manages
    this encryption for you without any additional actions on your part.
However, if you
    wanted to control and manage this encryption yourself, you can provide your
own
    encryption keys.
    By default, Google Compute Engine encrypts all data at rest. Compute Engine
handles and
    manages this encryption for you without any additional actions on your
part. However, if
    you wanted to control and manage this encryption yourself, you can provide
your own
    encryption keys.
    If you provide your own encryption keys, Compute Engine uses your key to
protect the
    Google-generated keys used to encrypt and decrypt your data. Only users who
can provide
    the correct key can use resources protected by a customer-supplied
encryption key.
    Google does not store your keys on its servers and cannot access your
protected data
    unless you provide the key. This also means that if you forget or lose your
key, there is no
    way for Google to recover the key or to recover any data encrypted with the
lost key.
    At least business critical VMs should have VM disks encrypted with CSEK.
