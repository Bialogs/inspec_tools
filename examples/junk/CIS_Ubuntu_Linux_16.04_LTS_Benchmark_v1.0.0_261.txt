6.1.9 Ensure permissions on /etc/gshadow- are configured (Scored)
Profile Applicability:

 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
The /etc/gshadow- file is used to store backup information about groups that is critical to
the security of those accounts, such as the hashed password and other security
information.

Although it is protected by default, the file permissions could be changed either
inadvertently or through malicious actions.

Run the following command and verify Uid and Gid are both 0/root and Access is 600 or
more restrictive:
# stat /etc/gshadowAccess: (0600/-rw-------)

Uid: (

0/

root)

Gid: (

0/

root)

Remediation:
Run the following command to set permissions on /etc/gshadow-:
# chown root:root /etc/gshadow# chmod 600 /etc/gshadow-
