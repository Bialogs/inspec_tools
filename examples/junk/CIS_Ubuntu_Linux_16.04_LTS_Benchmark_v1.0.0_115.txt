2.2.14 Ensure SNMP Server is not enabled (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) server is used to listen for SNMP
commands from an SNMP management system, execute the commands or collect the
information and then send results back to the requesting system.
Rationale:
The SNMP server communicates using SNMP v1, which transmits data in the clear and does
not require authentication to execute commands. Unless absolutely necessary, it is
recommended that the SNMP service not be used.
Audit:
Run the following command to verify snmpd is not enabled:
# systemctl is-enabled snmpd
disabled

Verify result is not "enabled".
Remediation:
Run the following command to disable snmpd:
# systemctl disable snmpd
