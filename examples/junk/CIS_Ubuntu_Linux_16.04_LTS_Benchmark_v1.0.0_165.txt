4.1.4 Ensure events that modify date and time information are collected
(Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 2 - Server
 Level 2 - Workstation
Description:
Capture events where the system date and/or time has been modified. The parameters in
this section are set to determine if the adjtimex (tune kernel clock), settimeofday (Set
time, using timeval and timezone structures) stime (using seconds since 1/1/1970) or
clock_settime (allows for the setting of several internal clocks and timers) system calls
have been executed and always write an audit record to the /var/log/audit.log file upon
exit, tagging the records with the identifier "time-change"
Rationale:
Unexpected changes in system date and/or time could be a sign of malicious activity on the
system.
Audit:
On a 32 bit system run the following command and verify the output matches:
# grep time-change /etc/audit/audit.rules
-a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S adjtimex -S settimeofday -S stime -k time-change
-a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S clock_settime -k time-change
-w /etc/localtime -p wa -k time-change

On a 64 bit system run the following command and verify the output matches:
# grep time-change /etc/audit/audit.rules
-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S adjtimex -S settimeofday -k time-change
-a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S adjtimex -S settimeofday -S stime -k time-change
-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S clock_settime -k time-change
-a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S clock_settime -k time-change
-w /etc/localtime -p wa -k time-change

Remediation:
For 32 bit systems add the following lines to the /etc/audit/audit.rules file:
