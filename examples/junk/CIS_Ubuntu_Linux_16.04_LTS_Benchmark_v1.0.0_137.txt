3.3 IPv6
IPv6 is a networking protocol that supersedes IPv4. It has more routable addresses and has
built in security. If IPv6 is to be used, follow this section of the benchmark to configure
IPv6, otherwise disable IPv6.

3.3.1 Ensure IPv6 router advertisements are not accepted (Not Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
This setting disables the system's ability to accept IPv6 router advertisements.
Rationale:
It is recommended that systems not accept router advertisements as they could be tricked
into routing traffic to compromised machines. Setting hard routes within the system
(usually a single default route to a trusted router) protects the system from bad routes.
Audit:
Run the following commands and verify output matches:
# sysctl net.ipv6.conf.all.accept_ra
net.ipv6.conf.all.accept_ra = 0
# sysctl net.ipv6.conf.default.accept_ra
net.ipv6.conf.default.accept_ra = 0

Remediation:
Set the following parameters in the /etc/sysctl.conf file:
net.ipv6.conf.all.accept_ra = 0
net.ipv6.conf.default.accept_ra = 0

Run the following commands to set the active kernel parameters:
# sysctl -w net.ipv6.conf.all.accept_ra=0
# sysctl -w net.ipv6.conf.default.accept_ra=0
# sysctl -w net.ipv6.route.flush=1
