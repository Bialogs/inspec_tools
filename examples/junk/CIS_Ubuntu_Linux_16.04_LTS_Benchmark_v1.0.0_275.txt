6.2.8 Ensure users' home directories permissions are 750 or more
restrictive (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
While the system administrator can establish secure permissions for users' home
directories, the users can easily override these.
Rationale:
Group or world-writable user home directories may enable malicious users to steal or
modify other users' data or to gain another user's system privileges.
Audit:
Run the following script and verify no results are returned:
#!/bin/bash
for dir in `cat /etc/passwd | egrep -v '(root|halt|sync|shutdown)' | awk -F: '($7 !=
"/usr/sbin/nologin") { print $6 }'`; do
dirperm=`ls -ld $dir | cut -f1 -d" "`
if [ `echo $dirperm | cut -c6 ` != "-" ]; then
echo "Group Write permission set on directory $dir"
fi
if [ `echo $dirperm | cut -c8 ` != "-" ]; then
echo "Other Read permission set on directory $dir"
fi
if [ `echo $dirperm | cut -c9 ` != "-" ]; then
echo "Other Write permission set on directory $dir"
fi
if [ `echo $dirperm | cut -c10 ` != "-" ]; then
echo "Other Execute permission set on directory $dir"
fi
done

Remediation:
Making global modifications to user home directories without alerting the user community
can result in unexpected outages and unhappy users. Therefore, it is recommended that a
monitoring policy be established to report user file permissions and determine the action
to be taken in accordance with site policy.
