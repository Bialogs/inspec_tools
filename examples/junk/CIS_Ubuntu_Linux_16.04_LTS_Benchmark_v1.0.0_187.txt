4.1.18 Ensure the audit configuration is immutable (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 2 - Server
 Level 2 - Workstation
Description:
Set system audit so that audit rules cannot be modified with auditctl. Setting the flag "-e
2" forces audit to be put in immutable mode. Audit changes can only be made on system
reboot.
Rationale:
In immutable mode, unauthorized users cannot execute changes to the audit system to
potentially hide malicious activity and then put the audit rules back. Users would most
likely notice a system reboot and that could alert administrators of an attempt to make
unauthorized audit changes.
Audit:
Run the following command and verify output matches:
# grep "^\s*[^#]" /etc/audit/audit.rules | tail -1
-e 2

Remediation:
Add the following line to the end of the/etc/audit/audit.rules file.
-e 2

4.2 Configure Logging
Logging services should be configured to prevent information leaks and to aggregate logs
on a remote server so that they can be reviewed in the event of a system compromise and
ease log analysis.
