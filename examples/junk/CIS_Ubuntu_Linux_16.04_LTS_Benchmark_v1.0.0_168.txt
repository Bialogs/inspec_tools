4.1.6 Ensure events that modify the system's network environment are
collected (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 2 - Server
 Level 2 - Workstation
Description:
Record changes to network environment files or system calls. The below parameters
monitor the sethostname (set the systems host name) or setdomainname (set the systems
domainname) system calls, and write an audit event on system call exit. The other
parameters monitor the /etc/issue and /etc/issue.net files (messages displayed prelogin), /etc/hosts (file containing host names and associated IP addresses) and
/etc/sysconfig/network (directory containing network interface scripts and
configurations) files.
Rationale:
Monitoring sethostname and setdomainname will identify potential unauthorized changes
to host and domainname of a system. The changing of these names could potentially break
security parameters that are set based on those names. The /etc/hosts file is monitored
for changes in the file that can indicate an unauthorized intruder is trying to change
machine associations with IP addresses and trick users and processes into connecting to
unintended machines. Monitoring /etc/issue and /etc/issue.net is important, as
intruders could put disinformation into those files and trick users into providing
information to the intruder. Monitoring /etc/sysconfig/network is important as it can
show if network interfaces or scripts are being modified in a way that can lead to the
machine becoming unavailable or compromised. All audit records will be tagged with the
identifier "system-locale."
Audit:
On a 32 bit system run the following command and verify the output matches:
# grep system-locale /etc/audit/audit.rules
-a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S sethostname -S setdomainname -k system-locale
-w /etc/issue -p wa -k system-locale
-w /etc/issue.net -p wa -k system-locale
-w /etc/hosts -p wa -k system-locale
-w /etc/network -p wa -k system-locale
-w /etc/networks -p wa -k system-locale
