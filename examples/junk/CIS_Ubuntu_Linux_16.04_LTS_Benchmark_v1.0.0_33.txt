1.1.8 Ensure nosuid option set on /var/tmp partition (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
The nosuid mount option specifies that the filesystem cannot contain setuid files.
Rationale:
Since the /var/tmp filesystem is only intended for temporary file storage, set this option to
ensure that users cannot create setuid files in /var/tmp.
Audit:
If a /var/tmp partition exists run the following command and verify that the nosuid option
is set on /var/tmp.
# mount | grep /var/tmp
tmpfs on /var/tmp type tmpfs (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime)

Remediation:
Edit the /etc/fstab file and add nosuid to the fourth field (mounting options) for
the /var/tmp partition. See the fstab(5) manual page for more information.
Run the following command to remount /var/tmp:
# mount -o remount,nosuid /var/tmp
