1.4.3 Ensure authentication required for single user mode (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
Single user mode is used for recovery when the system detects an issue during boot or by
manual selection from the bootloader.
Rationale:
Requiring authentication in single user mode prevents an unauthorized user from
rebooting the system into single user to gain root privileges without credentials.
Audit:
Perform the following to determine if a password is set for the root user:
# grep ^root:[*\!]: /etc/shadow

No results should be returned.
Remediation:
Run the following command and follow the prompts to set a password for the root user:
# passwd root
