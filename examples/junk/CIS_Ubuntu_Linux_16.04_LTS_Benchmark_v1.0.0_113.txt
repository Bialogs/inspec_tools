2.2.12 Ensure Samba is not enabled (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
The Samba daemon allows system administrators to configure their Linux systems to share
file systems and directories with Windows desktops. Samba will advertise the file systems
and directories via the Small Message Block (SMB) protocol. Windows desktop users will
be able to mount these directories and file systems as letter drives on their systems.
Rationale:
If there is no need to mount directories and file systems to Windows systems, then this
service can be deleted to reduce the potential attack surface.
Audit:
Run the following command to verify smbd is not enabled:
# systemctl is-enabled smbd
disabled

Verify result is not "enabled".
Remediation:
Run the following command to disable smbd:
# systemctl disable smbd
