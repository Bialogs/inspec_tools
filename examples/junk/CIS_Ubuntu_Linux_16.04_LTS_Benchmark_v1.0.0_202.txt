4.2.3 Ensure rsyslog or syslog-ng is installed (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
The rsyslog and syslog-ng software are recommended replacements to the original
syslogd daemon which provide improvements over syslogd, such as connection-oriented
(i.e. TCP) transmission of logs, the option to log to database formats, and the encryption of
log data en route to a central logging server.
Rationale:
The security enhancements of rsyslog and syslog-ng such as connection-oriented (i.e.
TCP) transmission of logs, the option to log to database formats, and the encryption of log
data en route to a central logging server) justify installing and configuring the package.
Audit:
Verify either rsyslog or syslog-ng is installed. Depending on the package management in
use one of the following command groups may provide the needed information:
# dpkg -s rsyslog
# dpkg -s syslog-ng

Remediation:
Install rsyslog or syslog-ng using one of the following commands:
# apt-get install rsyslog
# apt-get install syslog-ng
