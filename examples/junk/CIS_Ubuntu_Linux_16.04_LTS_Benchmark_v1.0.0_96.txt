2.1.8 Ensure telnet server is not enabled (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
The telnet-server package contains the telnet daemon, which accepts connections
from users from other systems via the telnet protocol.
Rationale:
The telnet protocol is insecure and unencrypted. The use of an unencrypted transmission
medium could allow a user with access to sniff network traffic the ability to steal
credentials. The ssh package provides an encrypted session and stronger security.
Audit:
Verify the telnet service is not enabled. Run the following command and verify results are
as indicated:
grep -R "^telnet" /etc/inetd.*

No results should be returned
check /etc/xinetd.conf and /etc/xinetd.d/* and verify all telnet services
have disable = yes set.
Remediation:
Comment out or remove any lines starting
with telnet from /etc/inetd.conf and /etc/inetd.d/*.
Set disable = yes on all telnet services in /etc/xinetd.conf and /etc/xinetd.d/*.
