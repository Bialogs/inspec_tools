4.1.1 Configure Data Retention
When auditing, it is important to carefully configure the storage requirements for audit
logs. By default, auditd will max out the log files at 5MB and retain only 4 copies of them.
Older versions will be deleted. It is possible on a system that the 20 MBs of audit logs may
fill up the system causing loss of audit data. While the recommendations here provide
guidance, check your site policy for audit storage requirements.

4.1.1.1 Ensure audit log storage size is configured (Not Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 2 - Server
 Level 2 - Workstation
Description:
Configure the maximum size of the audit log file. Once the log reaches the maximum size, it
will be rotated and a new log file will be started.
Rationale:
It is important that an appropriate size is determined for log files so that they do not impact
the system and audit data is not lost.
Audit:
Run the following command and ensure output is in compliance with site policy:
# grep max_log_file /etc/audit/auditd.conf
max_log_file = <MB>

Remediation:
Set the following parameter in /etc/audit/auditd.conf in accordance with site policy:
max_log_file = <MB>

Notes:
The max_log_file parameter is measured in megabytes.
