1.1.9 Ensure noexec option set on /var/tmp partition (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
The noexec mount option specifies that the filesystem cannot contain executable binaries.
Rationale:
Since the /var/tmp filesystem is only intended for temporary file storage, set this option to
ensure that users cannot run executable binaries from /var/tmp.
Audit:
If a /var/tmp partition exists run the following command and verify that the noexec option
is set on /var/tmp.
# mount | grep /var/tmp
tmpfs on /var/tmp type tmpfs (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime)

Remediation:
Edit the /etc/fstab file and add noexec to the fourth field (mounting options) for the
/var/tmp partition. See the fstab(5) manual page for more information.
Run the following command to remount /var/tmp:
# mount -o remount,noexec /var/tmp
