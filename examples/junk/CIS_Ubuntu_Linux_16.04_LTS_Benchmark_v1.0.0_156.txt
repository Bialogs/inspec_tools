For each port identified in the audit which does not have a firewall rule establish a proper
rule for accepting inbound connections:
# iptables -A INPUT -p <protocol> --dport <port> -m state --state NEW -j ACCEPT

Notes:
Changing firewall settings while connected over network can result in being locked out of
the system.
Remediation will only affect the active system firewall, be sure to configure the default
policy in your firewall management to apply on boot as well.
The remediation command opens up the port to traffic from all sources. Consult iptables
documentation and set any restrictions in compliance with site policy.
