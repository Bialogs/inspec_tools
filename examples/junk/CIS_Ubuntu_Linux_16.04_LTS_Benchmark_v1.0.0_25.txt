1.1.1.8 Ensure mounting of FAT filesystems is disabled (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 2 - Workstation
Description:
The FAT filesystem format is primarily used on older windows systems and portable USB
drives or flash modules. It comes in three types FAT12, FAT16, and FAT32 all of which are
supported by the vfat kernel module.
Rationale:
Removing support for unneeded filesystem types reduces the local attack surface of the
system. If this filesystem type is not needed, disable it.
Audit:
Run the following commands and verify the output is as indicated:
# modprobe -n -v vfat
install /bin/true
# lsmod | grep vfat
<No output>

Remediation:
Edit or create the file /etc/modprobe.d/CIS.conf and add the following line:
install vfat /bin/true

Impact:
FAT filesystems are often used on portable USB sticks and other flash media are commonly
used to transfer files between workstations, removing VFAT support may prevent the
ability to transfer files in this way.
