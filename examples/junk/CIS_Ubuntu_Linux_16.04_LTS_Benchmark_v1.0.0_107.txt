2.2.6 Ensure LDAP server is not enabled (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server

Description:
The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) was introduced as a replacement for
NIS/YP. It is a service that provides a method for looking up information from a central
database.
Rationale:
If the system will not need to act as an LDAP server, it is recommended that the software be
disabled to reduce the potential attack surface.
Audit:
Run the following command to verify slapd is not enabled:
# systemctl is-enabled slapd
disabled

Verify result is not "enabled".
Remediation:
Run the following command to disable slapd:
# systemctl disable slapd
