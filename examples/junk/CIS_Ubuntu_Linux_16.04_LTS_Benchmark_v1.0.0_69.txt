1.6.1.4 Ensure no unconfined daemons exist (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 2 - Server
 Level 2 - Workstation
Description:
Daemons that are not defined in SELinux policy will inherit the security context of their
parent process.
Rationale:
Since daemons are launched and descend from the init process, they will inherit the
security context label initrc_t. This could cause the unintended consequence of giving the
process more permission than it requires.
Audit:
Run the following command and verify not output is produced:
# ps -eZ | egrep "initrc" | egrep -vw "tr|ps|egrep|bash|awk" | tr ':' ' ' | awk '{
print $NF }'

Remediation:
Investigate any unconfined daemons found during the audit action. They may need to have
an existing security context assigned to them or a policy built for them.
Notes:
Occasionally certain daemons such as backup or centralized management software may
require running unconfined. Any such software should be carefully analyzed and
documented before such an exception is made.
