6.2 User and Group Settings
This section provides guidance on securing aspects of the users and groups.

6.2.1 Ensure password fields are not empty (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
An account with an empty password field means that anybody may log in as that user
without providing a password.
Rationale:
All accounts must have passwords or be locked to prevent the account from being used by
an unauthorized user.
Audit:
Run the following command and verify that no output is returned:
# cat /etc/shadow | awk -F: '($2 == "" ) { print $1 " does not have a password "}'

Remediation:
If any accounts in the /etc/shadow file do not have a password, run the following
command to lock the account until it can be determined why it does not have a password:
# passwd -l <username>

Also, check to see if the account is logged in and investigate what it is being used for to
determine if it needs to be forced off.
