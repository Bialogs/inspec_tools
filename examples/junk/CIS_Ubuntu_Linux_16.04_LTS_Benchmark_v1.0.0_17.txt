1.1.1 Disable unused filesystems
A number of uncommon filesystem types are supported under Linux. Removing support
for unneeded filesystem types reduces the local attack surface of the system. If a filesystem
type is not needed it should be disabled. Native Linux file systems are designed to ensure
that built-in security controls function as expected. Non-native filesystems can lead to
unexpected consequences to both the security and functionality of the system and should
be used with caution. Many filesystems are created for niche use cases and are not
maintained and supported as the operating systems are updated and patched. Users of
non-native filesystems should ensure that there is attention and ongoing support for them,
especially in light of frequent operating system changes.
Standard network connectivity and Internet access to cloud storage may make the use of
non-standard filesystem formats to directly attach heterogeneous devices much less
attractive.

Note: This should not be considered a comprehensive list of filesystems. You may wish to
consider additions to those listed here for your environment.

1.1.1.1 Ensure mounting of cramfs filesystems is disabled (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
The cramfs filesystem type is a compressed read-only Linux filesystem embedded in small
footprint systems. A cramfs image can be used without having to first decompress the
image.
Rationale:
Removing support for unneeded filesystem types reduces the local attack surface of the
server. If this filesystem type is not needed, disable it.
Audit:
Run the following commands and verify the output is as indicated:
