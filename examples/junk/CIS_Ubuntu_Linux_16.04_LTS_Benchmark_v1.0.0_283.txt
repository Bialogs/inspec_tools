6.2.15 Ensure all groups in /etc/passwd exist in /etc/group (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
Over time, system administration errors and changes can lead to groups being defined in
/etc/passwd but not in /etc/group.
Rationale:
Groups defined in the /etc/passwd file but not in the /etc/group file pose a threat to
system security since group permissions are not properly managed.
Audit:
Run the following script and verify no results are returned:
#!/bin/bash
for i in $(cut -s -d: -f4 /etc/passwd | sort -u ); do
grep -q -P "^.*?:[^:]*:$i:" /etc/group
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
echo "Group $i is referenced by /etc/passwd but does not exist in /etc/group"
fi
done

Remediation:
Analyze the output of the Audit step above and perform the appropriate action to correct
any discrepancies found.
