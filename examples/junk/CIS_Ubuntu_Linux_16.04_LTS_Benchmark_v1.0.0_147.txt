3.5.3 Ensure RDS is disabled (Not Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
The Reliable Datagram Sockets (RDS) protocol is a transport layer protocol designed to
provide low-latency, high-bandwidth communications between cluster nodes. It was
developed by the Oracle Corporation.
Rationale:
If the protocol is not being used, it is recommended that kernel module not be loaded,
disabling the service to reduce the potential attack surface.
Audit:
Run the following commands and verify the output is as indicated:
# modprobe -n -v rds
install /bin/true
# lsmod | grep rds
<No output>

Remediation:
Edit or create the file /etc/modprobe.d/CIS.conf and add the following line:
install rds /bin/true
