6.2.4 Ensure no legacy "+" entries exist in /etc/group (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
The character + in various files used to be markers for systems to insert data from NIS
maps at a certain point in a system configuration file. These entries are no longer required
on most systems, but may exist in files that have been imported from other platforms.
Rationale:
These entries may provide an avenue for attackers to gain privileged access on the system.
Audit:
Run the following command and verify that no output is returned:
# grep '^+:' /etc/group

Remediation:
Remove any legacy '+' entries from /etc/group if they exist.
