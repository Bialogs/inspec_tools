5.4.3 Ensure default group for the root account is GID 0 (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
The usermod command can be used to specify which group the root user belongs to. This
affects permissions of files that are created by the root user.
Rationale:
Using GID 0 for the root account helps prevent root-owned files from accidentally
becoming accessible to non-privileged users.
Audit:
Run the following command and verify the result is 0:
# grep "^root:" /etc/passwd | cut -f4 -d:
0

Remediation:
Run the following command to set the root user default group to GID 0:
# usermod -g 0 root
