4.2.2.5 Ensure remote syslog-ng messages are only accepted on
designated log hosts (Not Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
By default, syslog-ng does not listen for log messages coming in from remote systems.
Rationale:
The guidance in the section ensures that remote log hosts are configured to only accept
syslog-ng data from hosts within the specified domain and that those systems that are not
designed to be log hosts do not accept any remote syslog-ng messages. This provides
protection from spoofed log data and ensures that system administrators are reviewing
reasonably complete syslog data in a central location.
Audit:
Review the /etc/syslog-ng/syslog-ng.conf file and verify the following lines are configured
appropriately on designated log hosts:
source net{ tcp(); };
destination remote { file("/var/log/remote/${FULLHOST}-log"); };
log { source(net); destination(remote); };

Remediation:
On designated log hosts edit the /etc/syslog-ng/syslog-ng.conf file and configure the
following lines are appropriately:
source net{ tcp(); };
destination remote { file("/var/log/remote/${FULLHOST}-log"); };
log { source(net); destination(remote); };

On non designated log hosts edit the /etc/syslog-ng/syslog-ng.conf file and remove or
edit any sources that accept network sourced log messages.
Run the following command to restart syslog-ng:
# pkill -HUP syslog-ng
