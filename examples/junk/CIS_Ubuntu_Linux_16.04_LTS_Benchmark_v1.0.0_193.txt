4.2.1.5 Ensure remote rsyslog messages are only accepted on
designated log hosts. (Not Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
By default, rsyslog does not listen for log messages coming in from remote systems. The
ModLoad tells rsyslog to load the imtcp.so module so it can listen over a network via
TCP. The InputTCPServerRun option instructs rsyslogd to listen on the specified TCP
port.
Rationale:
The guidance in the section ensures that remote log hosts are configured to only accept
rsyslog data from hosts within the specified domain and that those systems that are not
designed to be log hosts do not accept any remote rsyslog messages. This provides
protection from spoofed log data and ensures that system administrators are reviewing
reasonably complete syslog data in a central location.
Audit:
Run the following commands and verify the resulting lines are uncommented on
designated log hosts and commented or removed on all others:
# grep '$ModLoad imtcp.so' /etc/rsyslog.conf
$ModLoad imtcp.so
# grep '$InputTCPServerRun' /etc/rsyslog.conf
$InputTCPServerRun 514

Remediation:
For hosts that are designated as log hosts, edit the /etc/rsyslog.conf file and uncomment or add the following lines:
$ModLoad imtcp.so
$InputTCPServerRun 514

For hosts that are not designated as log hosts, edit the /etc/rsyslog.conf file and
comment or remove the following lines:
# $ModLoad imtcp.so
# $InputTCPServerRun 514
