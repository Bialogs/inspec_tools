3.4.5 Ensure permissions on /etc/hosts.deny are 644 (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
The /etc/hosts.deny file contains network information that is used by many system
applications and therefore must be readable for these applications to operate.
Rationale:
It is critical to ensure that the /etc/hosts.deny file is protected from unauthorized write
access. Although it is protected by default, the file permissions could be changed either
inadvertently or through malicious actions.
Audit:
Run the following command and verify Uid and Gid are both 0/root and Access is 644:
# stat /etc/hosts.deny
Access: (0644/-rw-r--r--)

Uid: (

0/

root)

Gid: (

0/

root)

Remediation:
Run the following commands to set permissions on /etc/hosts.deny:
# chown root:root /etc/hosts.deny
# chmod 644 /etc/hosts.deny
