Making global modifications to users' files without alerting the user community can result
in unexpected outages and unhappy users. Therefore, it is recommended that a monitoring
policy be established to report user .netrc file permissions and determine the action to be
taken in accordance with site policy.
Notes:
While the complete removal of .netrc files is recommended if any are required on the
system secure permissions must be applied.
