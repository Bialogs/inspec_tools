Recommendations
1 Initial Setup
Items in this section are advised for all systems, but may be difficult or require extensive
preparation after the initial setup of the system.

1.1 Filesystem Configuration
Directories that are used for system-wide functions can be further protected by placing
them on separate partitions. This provides protection for resource exhaustion and enables
the use of mounting options that are applicable to the directory's intended use. Users' data
can be stored on separate partitions and have stricter mount options. A user partition is a
filesystem that has been established for use by the users and does not contain software for
system operations.
The recommendations in this section are easier to perform during initial system
installation. If the system is already installed, it is recommended that a full backup be
performed before repartitioning the system.

Note: If you are repartitioning a system that has already been installed, make sure the data
has been copied over to the new partition, unmount it and then remove the data from the
directory that was in the old partition. Otherwise it will still consume space in the old
partition that will be masked when the new filesystem is mounted. For example, if a system
is in single-user mode with no filesystems mounted and the administrator adds a lot of data
to the /tmp directory, this data will still consume space in / once the /tmp filesystem is
mounted unless it is removed first.
