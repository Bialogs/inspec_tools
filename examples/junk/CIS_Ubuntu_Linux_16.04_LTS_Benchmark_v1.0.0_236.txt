5.3.3 Ensure password reuse is limited (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
The /etc/security/opasswd file stores the users' old passwords and can be checked to
ensure that users are not recycling recent passwords.
Rationale:
Forcing users not to reuse their past 5 passwords make it less likely that an attacker will be
able to guess the password.
Note that these change only apply to accounts configured on the local system.
Audit:
Run the following commands and ensure the remember option is '5' or more and included in
all results:
# egrep '^password\s+sufficient\s+pam_unix.so' /etc/pam.d/common-password
password sufficient pam_unix.so remember=5

Remediation:
Edit the /etc/pam.d/common-password file to include the remember option and conform to
site policy as shown:
password sufficient pam_unix.so remember=5

Notes:
Additional module options may be set, recommendation only covers those listed here.
