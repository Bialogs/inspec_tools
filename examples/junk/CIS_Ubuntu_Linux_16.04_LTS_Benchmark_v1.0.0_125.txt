2.3.5 Ensure LDAP client is not installed (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) was introduced as a replacement for
NIS/YP. It is a service that provides a method for looking up information from a central
database.
Rationale:
If the system will not need to act as an LDAP client, it is recommended that the software be
removed to reduce the potential attack surface.
Audit:
Run the following command and verify ldap-utils is not installed:
# dpkg -s ldap-utils

Remediation:
Uninstall ldap-utils using the appropriate package manager or manual installation:
# apt-get remove ldap-utils

Impact:
Removing the LDAP client will prevent or inhibit using LDAP for authentication in your
environment.
