The recommendations in this section implement an audit policy that produces large
quantities of logged data. In some environments it can be challenging to store or process
these logs and as such they are marked as Level 2 for both Servers and Workstations.
Note: For 64 bit systems that have arch as a rule parameter, you will need two rules: one
for 64 bit and one for 32 bit systems. For 32 bit systems, only one rule is needed.

Note: Once all configuration changes have been made to /etc/audit/audit.rules, the
auditd configuration must be reloaded:
# service auditd reload
