1.1.19 Ensure noexec option set on removable media partitions (Not
Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
The noexec mount option specifies that the filesystem cannot contain executable binaries.
Rationale:
Setting this option on a file system prevents users from executing programs from the
removable media. This deters users from being able to introduce potentially malicious
software on the system.
Audit:
Run the following command and verify that the noexec option is set on all removable media
partitions.
# mount

Remediation:
Edit the /etc/fstab file and add noexec to the fourth field (mounting options) of all
removable media partitions. Look for entries that have mount points that contain words
such as floppy or cdrom. See the fstab(5) manual page for more information.
