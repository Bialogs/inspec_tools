1.5.3 Ensure address space layout randomization (ASLR) is enabled
(Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
Address space layout randomization (ASLR) is an exploit mitigation technique which
randomly arranges the address space of key data areas of a process.
Rationale:
Randomly placing virtual memory regions will make it difficult to write memory page
exploits as the memory placement will be consistently shifting.
Audit:
Run the following command and verify output matches:
# sysctl kernel.randomize_va_space
kernel.randomize_va_space = 2

Remediation:
Set the following parameter in the /etc/sysctl.conf file:
kernel.randomize_va_space = 2

Run the following command to set the active kernel parameter:
# sysctl -w kernel.randomize_va_space=2
