6.2.11 Ensure no users have .forward files (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
The .forward file specifies an email address to forward the user's mail to.
Rationale:
Use of the .forward file poses a security risk in that sensitive data may be inadvertently
transferred outside the organization. The .forward file also poses a risk as it can be used
to execute commands that may perform unintended actions.
Audit:
Run the following script and verify no results are returned:
#!/bin/bash
for dir in `cat /etc/passwd |\
awk -F: '{ print $6 }'`; do
if [ ! -h "$dir/.forward" -a -f "$dir/.forward" ]; then
echo ".forward file $dir/.forward exists"
fi
done

Remediation:
Making global modifications to users' files without alerting the user community can result
in unexpected outages and unhappy users. Therefore, it is recommended that a monitoring
policy be established to report user .forward files and determine the action to be taken in
accordance with site policy.
