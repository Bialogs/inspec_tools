Run the following command to review all installed packages. Note that this may be very
time consuming and may be best scheduled via the cron utility. It is recommended that the
output of this command be redirected to a file that can be reviewed later.
# dpkg --verify > <filename>

Remediation:
Correct any discrepancies found and rerun the audit until output is clean or risk is
mitigated or accepted.

Notes:
Since packages and important files may change with new updates and releases, it is
recommended to verify everything, not just a finite list of files. This can be a time
consuming task and results may depend on site policy therefore it is not a scorable
benchmark item, but is provided for those interested in additional security measures.
Some of the recommendations of this benchmark alter the state of files audited by this
recommendation. The audit command will alert for all changes to a file permissions even if
the new state is more secure than the default.
