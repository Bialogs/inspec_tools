2.2.1.2 Ensure ntp is configured (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
ntp is a daemon which implements the Network Time Protocol (NTP).

It is designed to
synchronize system clocks across a variety of systems and use a source that is highly
accurate. More information on NTP can be found at http://www.ntp.org. ntp can be
configured to be a client and/or a server.

This recommendation only applies if ntp is in use on the system.
Rationale:
If ntp is in use on the system proper configuration is vital to ensuring time synchronization
is working properly.
Audit:
Run the following command and verify output matches:
# grep "^restrict" /etc/ntp.conf
restrict -4 default kod nomodify notrap nopeer noquery
restrict -6 default kod nomodify notrap nopeer noquery

The -4 in the first line is optional and options after default can appear in any
order. Additional restriction lines may exist.
Run the following command and verify remote server is configured properly:
# grep "^server" /etc/ntp.conf
server <remote-server>

Multiple servers may be configured.
Verify that ntp is configured to run as the ntp user by running the following command:
# grep "RUNASUSER=ntp" /etc/init.d/ntp
RUNASUSER=ntp
