1.3 Filesystem Integrity Checking
AIDE is a file integrity checking tool, similar in nature to Tripwire. While it cannot prevent
intrusions, it can detect unauthorized changes to configuration files by alerting when the
files are changed. When setting up AIDE, decide internally what the site policy will be
concerning integrity checking. Review the AIDE quick start guide and AIDE documentation
before proceeding.

1.3.1 Ensure AIDE is installed (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
AIDE takes a snapshot of filesystem state including modification times, permissions, and
file hashes which can then be used to compare against the current state of the filesystem to
detect modifications to the system.
Rationale:
By monitoring the filesystem state compromised files can be detected to prevent or limit
the exposure of accidental or malicious misconfigurations or modified binaries.
Audit:
Run the following command and verify AIDE is installed:
# dpkg -s aide

Remediation:
Run the following command to install AIDE:
# apt-get install aide

Configure AIDE as appropriate for your environment. Consult the AIDE documentation for
options.
Initialize AIDE:
# aide --init
