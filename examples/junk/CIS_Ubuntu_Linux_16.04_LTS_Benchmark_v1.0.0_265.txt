6.1.13 Audit SUID executables (Not Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
The owner of a file can set the file's permissions to run with the owner's or group's
permissions, even if the user running the program is not the owner or a member of the
group. The most common reason for a SUID program is to enable users to perform
functions (such as changing their password) that require root privileges.
Rationale:
There are valid reasons for SUID programs, but it is important to identify and review such
programs to ensure they are legitimate.
Audit:
Run the following command to list SUID files:
# df --local -P | awk {'if (NR!=1) print $6'} | xargs -I '{}' find '{}' -xdev -type f
-perm -4000

The command above only searches local filesystems, there may still be compromised items
on network mounted partitions. Additionally the --local option to df is not universal to
all versions, it can be omitted to search all filesystems on a system including network
mounted filesystems or the following command can be run manually for each partition:
# find <partition> -xdev -type f -perm -4000

Remediation:
Ensure that no rogue SUID programs have been introduced into the system. Review the
files returned by the action in the Audit section and confirm the integrity of these binaries.
