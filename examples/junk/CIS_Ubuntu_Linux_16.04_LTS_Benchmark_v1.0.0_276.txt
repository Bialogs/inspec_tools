6.2.9 Ensure users own their home directories (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
The user home directory is space defined for the particular user to set local environment
variables and to store personal files.
Rationale:
Since the user is accountable for files stored in the user home directory, the user must be
the owner of the directory.
Audit:
Run the following script and verify no results are returned:
#!/bin/bash
cat /etc/passwd | awk -F: '{ print $1 " " $3 " " $6 }' | while read user uid dir; do
if [ $uid -ge 1000 -a -d "$dir" -a $user != "nfsnobody" ]; then
owner=$(stat -L -c "%U" "$dir")
if [ "$owner" != "$user" ]; then
echo "The home directory ($dir) of user $user is owned by $owner."
fi
fi
done

Remediation:
Change the ownership of any home directories that are not owned by the defined user to
the correct user.
