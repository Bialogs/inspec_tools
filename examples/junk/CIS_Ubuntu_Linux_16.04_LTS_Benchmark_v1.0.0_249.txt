5.5 Ensure root login is restricted to system console (Not Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
The file /etc/securetty contains a list of valid terminals that may be logged in directly as
root.
Rationale:
Since the system console has special properties to handle emergency situations, it is
important to ensure that the console is in a physically secure location and that
unauthorized consoles have not been defined.
Audit:
# cat /etc/securetty

Remediation:
Remove entries for any consoles that are not in a physically secure location.
