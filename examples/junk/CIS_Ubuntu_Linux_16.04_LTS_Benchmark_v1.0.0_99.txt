2.2.1 Time Synchronization
It is recommended that physical systems and virtual guests lacking direct access to the
physical host's clock be configured to synchronize their time using a service such as NTP or
chrony.

2.2.1.1 Ensure time synchronization is in use (Not Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
System time should be synchronized between all systems in an environment. This is
typically done by establishing an authoritative time server or set of servers and having all
systems synchronize their clocks to them.
Rationale:
Time synchronization is important to support time sensitive security mechanisms like
Kerberos and also ensures log files have consistent time records across the enterprise,
which aids in forensic investigations.
Audit:
On physical systems or virtual systems where host based time synchronization is not
available run the following commands and verify either NTP or chrony is installed:
# dpkg -s ntp
# dpkg -s chrony

On virtual systems where host based time synchronization is available consult your
virtualization software documentation and verify that host based synchronization is in use.
Remediation:
On physical systems or virtual systems where host based time synchronization is not
available install NTP or chrony using one of the following commands:
# apt-get install ntp
# apt-get install chrony

On virtual systems where host based time synchronization is available consult your
virtualization software documentation and setup host based synchronization.
