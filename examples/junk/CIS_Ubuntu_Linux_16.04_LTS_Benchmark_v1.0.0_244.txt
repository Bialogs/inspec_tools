5.4.1.4 Ensure inactive password lock is 30 days or less (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
User accounts that have been inactive for over a given period of time can be automatically
disabled. It is recommended that accounts that are inactive for 30 days after password
expiration be disabled.
Rationale:
Inactive accounts pose a threat to system security since the users are not logging in to
notice failed login attempts or other anomalies.
Audit:
Run the following command and verify INACTIVE is 30 or less:
# useradd -D | grep INACTIVE
INACTIVE=35

Verify all users with a password have Password inactive no more than 30 days after
password expires:
# egrep ^[^:]+:[^\!*] /etc/shadow | cut -d: -f1
<list of users>
# chage --list <user>
Password inactive

: <date>

Remediation:
Run the following command to set the default password inactivity period to 30 days:
# useradd -D -f 30

Modify user parameters for all users with a password set to match:
# chage --inactive 30 <user>

Notes:
You can also check this setting in /etc/shadow directly. The 7th field should be 30 or less
for all users with a password.
