5.4.4 Ensure default user umask is 027 or more restrictive (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
The default umask determines the permissions of files created by users. The user creating
the file has the discretion of making their files and directories readable by others via the
chmod command. Users who wish to allow their files and directories to be readable by
others by default may choose a different default umask by inserting the umask command
into the standard shell configuration files (.profile, .bashrc, etc.) in their home
directories.
Rationale:
Setting a very secure default value for umask ensures that users make a conscious choice
about their file permissions. A default umask setting of 077 causes files and directories
created by users to not be readable by any other user on the system. A umask of 027 would
make files and directories readable by users in the same Unix group, while a umask of 022
would make files readable by every user on the system.
Audit:
Run the following commands and verify all umask lines returned are 027 or more
restrictive.
# grep "^umask" /etc/bash.bashrc
umask 027
# grep "^umask" /etc/profile
umask 027

Remediation:
Edit the /etc/bash.bashrc and /etc/profile files (and the appropriate files for any other
shell supported on your system) and add or edit any umask parameters as follows:
umask 027
