1.5.4 Ensure prelink is disabled (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
is a program that modifies ELF shared libraries and ELF dynamically linked
binaries in such a way that the time needed for the dynamic linker to perform relocations
at startup significantly decreases.
prelink

Rationale:
The prelinking feature can interfere with the operation of AIDE, because it changes
binaries. Prelinking can also increase the vulnerability of the system if a malicious user is
able to compromise a common library such as libc.
Audit:
Run the following command and verify prelink is not installed:
# dpkg -s prelink

Remediation:
Run the following command to restore binaries to normal:
# prelink -ua

Run the following command to uninstall prelink:
# apt-get remove prelink

1.6 Mandatory Access Control
Mandatory Access Control (MAC) provides an additional layer of access restrictions to
processes on top of the base Discretionary Access Controls. By restricting how processes
can access files and resources on a system the potential impact from vulnerabilities in the
processes can be reduced.
