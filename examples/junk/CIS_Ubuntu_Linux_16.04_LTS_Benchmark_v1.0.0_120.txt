2.3 Service Clients
A number of insecure services exist. While disabling the servers prevents a local attack
against these services, it is advised to remove their clients unless they are required.

Note: This should not be considered a comprehensive list of insecure service clients. You
may wish to consider additions to those listed here for your environment.

2.3.1 Ensure NIS Client is not installed (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
The Network Information Service (NIS), formerly known as Yellow Pages, is a client-server
directory service protocol used to distribute system configuration files. The NIS client
(ypbind) was used to bind a machine to an NIS server and receive the distributed
configuration files.
Rationale:
The NIS service is inherently an insecure system that has been vulnerable to DOS attacks,
buffer overflows and has poor authentication for querying NIS maps. NIS generally has
been replaced by such protocols as Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP). It is
recommended that the service be removed.
Audit:
Run the following command and verify nis is not installed:
dpkg -s nis

Remediation:
Run the following command to uninstall nis:
apt-get remove nis
