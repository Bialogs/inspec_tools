Run the following commands and verify all password requirements are as listed or stricter:
# grep pam_pwquality.so /etc/pam.d/common-password
password requisite pam_pwquality.so try_first_pass retry=3
# grep ^minlen /etc/security/pwquality.conf
minlen=14
# grep ^dcredit /etc/security/pwquality.conf
dcredit=-1
# grep ^lcredit /etc/security/pwquality.conf
lcredit=-1
# grep ^ocredit /etc/security/pwquality.conf
ocredit=-1
# grep ^ucredit /etc/security/pwquality.conf
ucredit=-1
