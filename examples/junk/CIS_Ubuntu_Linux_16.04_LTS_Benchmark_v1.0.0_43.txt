1.1.18 Ensure nosuid option set on removable media partitions (Not
Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
The nosuid mount option specifies that the filesystem cannot contain setuid files.
Rationale:
Setting this option on a file system prevents users from introducing privileged programs
onto the system and allowing non-root users to execute them.
Audit:
Run the following command and verify that the nosuid option is set on all removable media
partitions.
# mount

Remediation:
Edit the /etc/fstab file and add nosuid to the fourth field (mounting options) of all
removable media partitions. Look for entries that have mount points that contain words
such as floppy or cdrom. See the fstab(5) manual page for more information.
