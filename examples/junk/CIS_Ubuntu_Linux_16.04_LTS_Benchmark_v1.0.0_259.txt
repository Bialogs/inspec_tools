6.1.7 Ensure permissions on /etc/shadow- are configured (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
The /etc/shadow- file is used to store backup information about user accounts that is
critical to the security of those accounts, such as the hashed password and other security
information.
Rationale:
It is critical to ensure that the /etc/shadow- file is protected from unauthorized access.
Although it is protected by default, the file permissions could be changed either
inadvertently or through malicious actions.
Audit:
Run the following command and verify Uid and Gid are both 0/root and Access is 600 or
more restrictive:
# stat /etc/shadowAccess: (0600/-rw-------)

Uid: (

0/

root)

Gid: (

0/

root)

Remediation:
Run the following command to set permissions on /etc/shadow-:
# chown root:root /etc/shadow# chmod 600 /etc/shadow-
