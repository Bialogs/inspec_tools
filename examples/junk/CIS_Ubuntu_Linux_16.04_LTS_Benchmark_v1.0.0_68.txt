1.6.1.3 Ensure SELinux policy is configured (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 2 - Server
 Level 2 - Workstation
Description:
Configure SELinux to meet or exceed the default targeted policy, which constrains daemons
and system software only.
Rationale:
Security configuration requirements vary from site to site. Some sites may mandate a
policy that is stricter than the default policy, which is perfectly acceptable. This item is
intended to ensure that at least the default recommendations are met.
Audit:
Run the following commands and ensure output matches "ubuntu", "default" or "mls":
# grep SELINUXTYPE= /etc/selinux/config
SELINUXTYPE=ubuntu
# sestatus
Policy from config file: ubuntu

Remediation:
Edit the /etc/selinux/config file to set the SELINUXTYPE parameter:
SELINUXTYPE=ubuntu

Notes:
If your organization requires stricter policies, ensure that they are set in
the /etc/selinux/config file.
