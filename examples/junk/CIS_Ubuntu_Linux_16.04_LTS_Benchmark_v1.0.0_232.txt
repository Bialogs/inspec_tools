5.2.15 Ensure SSH warning banner is configured (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
The Banner parameter specifies a file whose contents must be sent to the remote user
before authentication is permitted. By default, no banner is displayed.
Rationale:
Banners are used to warn connecting users of the particular site's policy regarding
connection. Presenting a warning message prior to the normal user login may assist the
prosecution of trespassers on the computer system.
Audit:
Run the following command and verify that output matches:
# grep "^Banner" /etc/ssh/sshd_config
Banner /etc/issue.net

Remediation:
Edit the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file to set the parameter as follows:
Banner /etc/issue.net
