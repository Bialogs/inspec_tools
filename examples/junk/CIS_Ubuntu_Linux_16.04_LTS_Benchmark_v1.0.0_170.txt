4.1.7 Ensure events that modify the system's Mandatory Access
Controls are collected (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 2 - Server
 Level 2 - Workstation
Description:
Monitor SELinux/AppArmor mandatory access controls. The parameters below monitor
any write access (potential additional, deletion or modification of files in the directory) or
attribute changes to the /etc/selinux or /etc/apparmor and /etc/apparmor.d directories.
Rationale:
Changes to files in these directories could indicate that an unauthorized user is attempting
to modify access controls and change security contexts, leading to a compromise of the
system.
Audit:
On systems using SELinux run the following command and verify output matches:
# grep MAC-policy /etc/audit/audit.rules
-w /etc/selinux/ -p wa -k MAC-policy

On systems using AppArmor run the following command and verify output matches:
# grep MAC-policy /etc/audit/audit.rules
-w /etc/apparmor/ -p wa -k MAC-policy
-w /etc/apparmor.d/ -p wa -k MAC-policy

Remediation:
On systems using SELinux add the following line to the /etc/audit/audit.rules file:
-w /etc/selinux/ -p wa -k MAC-policy

On systems using AppArmor add the following line to the /etc/audit/audit.rules file:
-w /etc/apparmor/ -p wa -k MAC-policy
-w /etc/apparmor.d/ -p wa -k MAC-policy
