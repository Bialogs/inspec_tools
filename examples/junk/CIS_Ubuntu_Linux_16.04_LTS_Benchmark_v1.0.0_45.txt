1.1.20 Ensure sticky bit is set on all world-writable directories (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
Setting the sticky bit on world writable directories prevents users from deleting or
renaming files in that directory that are not owned by them.
Rationale:
This feature prevents the ability to delete or rename files in world writable directories
(such as /tmp) that are owned by another user.
Audit:
Run the following command to verify no world writable directories exist without the sticky
bit set:
# df --local -P | awk {'if (NR!=1) print $6'} | xargs -I '{}' find '{}' -xdev -type d
\( -perm -0002 -a ! -perm -1000 \) 2>/dev/null

No output should be returned.
Remediation:
Run the following command to set the sticky bit on all world writable directories:
# df --local -P | awk {'if (NR!=1) print $6'} | xargs -I '{}' find '{}' -xdev -type d
-perm -0002 2>/dev/null | chmod a+t
