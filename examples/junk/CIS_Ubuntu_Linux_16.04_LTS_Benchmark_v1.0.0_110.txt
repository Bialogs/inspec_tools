2.2.9 Ensure FTP Server is not enabled (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
The File Transfer Protocol (FTP) provides networked computers with the ability to transfer
files.
Rationale:
FTP does not protect the confidentiality of data or authentication credentials. It is
recommended sftp be used if file transfer is required. Unless there is a need to run the
system as a FTP server (for example, to allow anonymous downloads), it is recommended
that the package be deleted to reduce the potential attack surface.
Audit:
Run the following command to verify vsftpd is not enabled:
# systemctl is-enabled vsftpd
disabled

Verify result is not "enabled".
Remediation:
Run the following command to disable vsftpd:
# systemctl disable vsftpd

Notes:
Additional FTP servers also exist and should be audited.
