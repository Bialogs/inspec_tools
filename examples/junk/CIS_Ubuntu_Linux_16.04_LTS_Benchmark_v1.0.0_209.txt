5.1.5 Ensure permissions on /etc/cron.weekly are configured (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
The /etc/cron.weekly directory contains system cron jobs that need to run on a weekly
basis. The files in this directory cannot be manipulated by the crontab command, but are
instead edited by system administrators using a text editor. The commands below restrict
read/write and search access to user and group root, preventing regular users from
accessing this directory.
Rationale:
Granting write access to this directory for non-privileged users could provide them the
means for gaining unauthorized elevated privileges. Granting read access to this directory
could give an unprivileged user insight in how to gain elevated privileges or circumvent
auditing controls.
Audit:
Run the following command and verify Uid and Gid are both 0/root and Access does not
grant permissions to group or other:
# stat /etc/cron.weekly
Access: (0600/-rw-------)

Uid: (

0/

root)

Gid: (

0/

root)

Remediation:
Run the following commands to set ownership and permissions on /etc/cron.weekly:
# chown root:root /etc/cron.weekly
# chmod og-rwx /etc/cron.weekly
