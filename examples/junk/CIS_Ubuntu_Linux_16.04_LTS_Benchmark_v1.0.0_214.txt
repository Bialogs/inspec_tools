5.2 SSH Server Configuration
SSH is a secure, encrypted replacement for common login services such as telnet, ftp,
rlogin, rsh, and rcp. It is strongly recommended that sites abandon older clear-text login
protocols and use SSH to prevent session hijacking and sniffing of sensitive data off the
network.

Note: The recommendations in this section only apply if the SSH daemon is installed on the
system, if remote access is not required the SSH daemon can be removed and this section
skipped.

Note: Once all configuration changes have been made to /etc/ssh/sshd_config, the sshd
configuration must be reloaded:
# service sshd reload

grant permissions to group or other:
