3.6.3 Ensure loopback traffic is configured (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
Configure the loopback interface to accept traffic. Configure all other interfaces to deny
traffic to the loopback network (127.0.0.0/8).
Rationale:
Loopback traffic is generated between processes on machine and is typically critical to
operation of the system. The loopback interface is the only place that loopback network
(127.0.0.0/8) traffic should be seen, all other interfaces should ignore traffic on this
network as an anti-spoofing measure.
Audit:
Run the following commands and verify output includes the listed rules in order (packet
and byte counts may differ):
# iptables -L INPUT -v -n
Chain INPUT (policy DROP 0 packets, 0 bytes)
pkts bytes target
prot opt in
out
0
0 ACCEPT
all -- lo
*
0
0 DROP
all -- *
*

source
0.0.0.0/0
127.0.0.0/8

destination
0.0.0.0/0
0.0.0.0/0

# iptables -L OUTPUT -v -n
Chain OUTPUT (policy DROP 0 packets, 0 bytes)
pkts bytes target
prot opt in
out
0
0 ACCEPT
all -- *
lo

source
0.0.0.0/0

destination
0.0.0.0/0

Remediation:
Run the following commands to implement the loopback rules:
# iptables -A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT
# iptables -A OUTPUT -o lo -j ACCEPT
# iptables -A INPUT -s 127.0.0.0/8 -j DROP

Notes:
Changing firewall settings while connected over network can result in being locked out of
the system.
