4.1.1.2 Ensure system is disabled when audit logs are full (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 2 - Server
 Level 2 - Workstation
Description:
The auditd daemon can be configured to halt the system when the audit logs are full.
Rationale:
In high security contexts, the risk of detecting unauthorized access or nonrepudiation
exceeds the benefit of the system's availability.
Audit:
Run the following commands and verify output matches:
# grep space_left_action /etc/audit/auditd.conf
space_left_action = email
# grep action_mail_acct /etc/audit/auditd.conf
action_mail_acct = root
# grep admin_space_left_action /etc/audit/auditd.conf
admin_space_left_action = halt

Remediation:
Set the following parameters in /etc/audit/auditd.conf:
space_left_action = email
action_mail_acct = root
admin_space_left_action = halt
