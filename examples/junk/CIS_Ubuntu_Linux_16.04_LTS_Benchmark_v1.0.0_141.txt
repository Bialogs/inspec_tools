3.4.2 Ensure /etc/hosts.allow is configured (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
The /etc/hosts.allow file specifies which IP addresses are permitted to connect to the
host. It is intended to be used in conjunction with the /etc/hosts.deny file.
Rationale:
The /etc/hosts.allow file supports access control by IP and helps ensure that only
authorized systems can connect to the system.
Audit:
Run the following command and verify the contents of the /etc/hosts.allow file:
# cat /etc/hosts.allow

Remediation:
Run the following command to create /etc/hosts.allow:
# echo "ALL: <net>/<mask>, <net>/<mask>, ..." >/etc/hosts.allow

where each <net>/<mask> combination (for example, "192.168.1.0/255.255.255.0")
represents one network block in use by your organization that requires access to this
system.
Notes:
Contents of the /etc/hosts.allow file will vary depending on your network configuration.
