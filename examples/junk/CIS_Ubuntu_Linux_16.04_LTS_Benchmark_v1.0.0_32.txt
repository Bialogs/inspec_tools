1.1.7 Ensure nodev option set on /var/tmp partition (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
The nodev mount option specifies that the filesystem cannot contain special devices.
Rationale:
Since the /var/tmp filesystem is not intended to support devices, set this option to ensure
that users cannot attempt to create block or character special devices in /var/tmp.
Audit:
If a /var/tmp partition exists run the following command and verify that the nodev option is
set on /var/tmp.
# mount | grep /var/tmp
tmpfs on /var/tmp type tmpfs (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime)

Remediation:
Edit the /etc/fstab file and add nodev to the fourth field (mounting options) for
the /var/tmp partition. See the fstab(5) manual page for more information.
Run the following command to remount /var/tmp:
# mount -o remount,nodev /var/tmp
