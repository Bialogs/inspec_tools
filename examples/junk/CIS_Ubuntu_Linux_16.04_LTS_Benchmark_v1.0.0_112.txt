2.2.11 Ensure IMAP and POP3 server is not enabled (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
dovecot is an open source IMAP and POP3 server for Linux based systems.

Rationale:
Unless POP3 and/or IMAP servers are to be provided by this system, it is recommended
that the service be deleted to reduce the potential attack surface.
Audit:
Run the following command to verify dovecot is not enabled:
# systemctl is-enabled dovecot
disabled

Verify result is not "enabled".
Remediation:
Run the following command to disable dovecot:
# systemctl disable dovecot

Notes:
Several IMAP/POP3 servers exist and can use other service names. exim and cyrusimap are example services that provide an HTTP server. These and other services should
also be audited.
