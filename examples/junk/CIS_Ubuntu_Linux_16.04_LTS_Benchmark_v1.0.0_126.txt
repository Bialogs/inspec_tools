3.1 Network Parameters (Host Only)
The following network parameters are intended for use if the system is to act as a host
only. A system is considered host only if the system has a single interface, or has multiple
interfaces but will not be configured as a router.

3.1.1 Ensure IP forwarding is disabled (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
The net.ipv4.ip_forward flag is used to tell the system whether it can forward packets or
not.
Rationale:
Setting the flag to 0 ensures that a system with multiple interfaces (for example, a hard
proxy), will never be able to forward packets, and therefore, never serve as a router.
Audit:
Run the following command and verify output matches:
# sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward
net.ipv4.ip_forward = 0

Remediation:
Set the following parameter in the /etc/sysctl.conf file:
net.ipv4.ip_forward = 0

Run the following commands to set the active kernel parameters:
# sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=0
# sysctl -w net.ipv4.route.flush=1
