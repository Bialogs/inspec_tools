4.1.8 Ensure login and logout events are collected (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 2 - Server
 Level 2 - Workstation
Description:
Monitor login and logout events. The parameters below track changes to files associated
with login/logout events. The file /var/log/faillog tracks failed events from login. The
file /var/log/lastlog maintain records of the last time a user successfully logged in. The
file /var/log/tallylog maintains records of failures via the pam_tally2 module
Rationale:
Monitoring login/logout events could provide a system administrator with information
associated with brute force attacks against user logins.
Audit:
Run the following command and verify output matches:
# grep logins /etc/audit/audit.rules
-w /var/log/faillog -p wa -k logins
-w /var/log/lastlog -p wa -k logins
-w /var/log/tallylog -p wa -k logins

Remediation:
Add the following lines to the /etc/audit/audit.rules file:
-w /var/log/faillog -p wa -k logins
-w /var/log/lastlog -p wa -k logins
-w /var/log/tallylog -p wa -k logins
