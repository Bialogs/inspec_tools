1.3.2 Ensure filesystem integrity is regularly checked (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
Periodic checking of the filesystem integrity is needed to detect changes to the filesystem.
Rationale:
Periodic file checking allows the system administrator to determine on a regular basis if
critical files have been changed in an unauthorized fashion.
Audit:
Run the following commands to determine if there is a cron job scheduled to run the aide
check.
# crontab -u root -l | grep aide
# grep -r aide /etc/cron.* /etc/crontab

Ensure a cron job in compliance with site policy is returned.
Remediation:
Run the following command:
# crontab -u root -e

Add the following line to the crontab:
0 5 * * * /usr/bin/aide --check

Notes:
The checking in this recommendation occurs every day at 5am. Alter the frequency and
time of the checks in compliance with site policy.
