4.2.2.4 Ensure syslog-ng is configured to send logs to a remote log host
(Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
The syslog-ng utility supports the ability to send logs it gathers to a remote log host or to
receive messages from remote hosts, reducing administrative overhead.
Rationale:
Storing log data on a remote host protects log integrity from local attacks. If an attacker
gains root access on the local system, they could tamper with or remove log data that is
stored on the local system
Audit:
Review the /etc/syslog-ng/syslog-ng.conf file and verify that logs are sent to a central
host (where logfile.example.com is the name of your central log host):
destination logserver { tcp("logfile.example.com" port(514)); };
log { source(src); destination(logserver); };

Remediation:
Edit the /etc/syslog-ng/syslog-ng.conf file and add the following lines (where
logfile.example.com is the name of your central log host).
destination logserver { tcp("logfile.example.com" port(514)); };
log { source(src); destination(logserver); };

Run the following command to restart syslog-ng:
# pkill -HUP syslog-ng
