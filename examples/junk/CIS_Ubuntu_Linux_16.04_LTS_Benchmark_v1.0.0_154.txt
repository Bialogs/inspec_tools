Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
Configure the firewall rules for new outbound, and established connections.
Rationale:
If rules are not in place for new outbound, and established connections all packets will be
dropped by the default policy preventing network usage.
Audit:
Run the following command and verify all rules for new outbound, and established
connections match site policy:
# iptables -L -v -n

Remediation:
Configure iptables in accordance with site policy. The following commands will implement
a policy to allow all outbound connections and all established connections:
#
#
#
#
#

Notes:
Changing firewall settings while connected over network can result in being locked out of
the system.

policy in your firewall management to apply on boot as well.
