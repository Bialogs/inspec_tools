2.2.5 Ensure DHCP Server is not enabled (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a service that allows machines to be
dynamically assigned IP addresses.
Rationale:
Unless a system is specifically set up to act as a DHCP server, it is recommended that this
service be deleted to reduce the potential attack surface.
Audit:
Run the following commands to verify dhcpd is not enabled:
# systemctl is-enabled isc-dhcp-server
disabled
# systemctl is-enabled isc-dhcp-server6
disabled

Verify both results are not "enabled".
Remediation:
Run the following commands to disable dhcpd:
# systemctl disable isc-dhcp-server
# systemctl disable isc-dhcp-server6
