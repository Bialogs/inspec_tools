2.1.2 Ensure daytime services are not enabled (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
daytime is a network service that responds with the server's current date and time. This

service is intended for debugging and testing purposes. It is recommended that this service
be disabled.
Rationale:
Disabling this service will reduce the remote attack surface of the system.
Audit:
Verify the daytime service is not enabled. Run the following command and verify results
are as indicated:
grep -R "^daytime" /etc/inetd.*

No results should be returned
check /etc/xinetd.conf and /etc/xinetd.d/* and verify all daytime services
have disable = yes set.
Remediation:
Comment out or remove any lines starting
with daytime from /etc/inetd.conf and /etc/inetd.d/*.
Set disable = yes on all daytime services in /etc/xinetd.conf and /etc/xinetd.d/*.
