5.6 Ensure access to the su command is restricted (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
The su command allows a user to run a command or shell as another user. The program
has been superseded by sudo, which allows for more granular control over privileged
access. Normally, the su command can be executed by any user. By uncommenting the
pam_wheel.so statement in /etc/pam.d/su, the su command will only allow users in the
wheel group to execute su.
Rationale:
Restricting the use of su, and using sudo in its place, provides system administrators better
control of the escalation of user privileges to execute privileged commands. The sudo utility
also provides a better logging and audit mechanism, as it can log each command executed
via sudo, whereas su can only record that a user executed the su program.
Audit:
Run the following command and verify output includes matching line:
# grep pam_wheel.so /etc/pam.d/su
auth required pam_wheel.so use_uid

Run the following command and verify users in wheel group match site policy:
# grep wheel /etc/group
wheel:x:10:root,<user list>

Remediation:
Add the following line to the /etc/pam.d/su file:
auth required pam_wheel.so use_uid

Create a comma separated list of users in the wheel statement in the /etc/group file:
wheel:x:10:root,<user list>
