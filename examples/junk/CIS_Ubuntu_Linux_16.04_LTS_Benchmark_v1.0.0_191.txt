4.2.1.3 Ensure rsyslog default file permissions configured (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
rsyslog will create logfiles that do not already exist on the system. This setting controls
what permissions will be applied to these newly created files.
Rationale:
It is important to ensure that log files have the correct permissions to ensure that sensitive
data is archived and protected.
Audit:
Run the following command and verify that $FileCreateMode is 0640 or more restrictive:
# grep ^\$FileCreateMode /etc/rsyslog.conf

Remediation:
Edit the /etc/rsyslog.conf and set $FileCreateMode to 0640 or more restrictive:
$FileCreateMode 0640

References:
1. See the rsyslog.conf(5) man page for more information.
Notes:
You should also ensure this is not overridden with less restrictive settings in
any /etc/rsyslog.d/* conf file.
