6.2.18 Ensure no duplicate user names exist (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
Although the useradd program will not let you create a duplicate user name, it is possible
for an administrator to manually edit the /etc/passwd file and change the user name.
Rationale:
If a user is assigned a duplicate user name, it will create and have access to files with the
first UID for that username in /etc/passwd. For example, if "test4" has a UID of 1000 and a
subsequent "test4" entry has a UID of 2000, logging in as "test4" will use UID 1000.
Effectively, the UID is shared, which is a security problem.
Audit:
Run the following script and verify no results are returned:
#!/bin/bash
cat /etc/passwd | cut -f1 -d":" | sort -n | uniq -c | while read x ; do
[ -z "${x}" ] && break
set - $x
if [ $1 -gt 1 ]; then
uids=`awk -F: '($1 == n) { print $3 }' n=$2 /etc/passwd | xargs`
echo "Duplicate User Name ($2): ${uids}"
fi
done

Remediation:
Based on the results of the audit script, establish unique user names for the users. File
ownerships will automatically reflect the change as long as the users have unique UIDs.
