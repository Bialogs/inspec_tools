4.1.5 Ensure events that modify user/group information are collected
(Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 2 - Server
 Level 2 - Workstation
Description:
Record events affecting the group, passwd (user IDs), shadow and gshadow (passwords) or
/etc/security/opasswd (old passwords, based on remember parameter in the PAM
configuration) files. The parameters in this section will watch the files to see if they have
been opened for write or have had attribute changes (e.g. permissions) and tag them with
the identifier "identity" in the audit log file.
Rationale:
Unexpected changes to these files could be an indication that the system has been
compromised and that an unauthorized user is attempting to hide their activities or
compromise additional accounts.
Audit:
Run the following command and verify output matches:
# grep identity /etc/audit/audit.rules
-w /etc/group -p wa -k identity
-w /etc/passwd -p wa -k identity
-w /etc/gshadow -p wa -k identity
-w /etc/shadow -p wa -k identity
-w /etc/security/opasswd -p wa -k identity

Remediation:
Add the following lines to the /etc/audit/audit.rules file:
-w
-w
-w
-w
-w

/etc/group -p wa -k identity
/etc/passwd -p wa -k identity
/etc/gshadow -p wa -k identity
/etc/shadow -p wa -k identity
/etc/security/opasswd -p wa -k identity
