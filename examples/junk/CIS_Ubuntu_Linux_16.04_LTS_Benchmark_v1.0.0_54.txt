1.4.2 Ensure bootloader password is set (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
Setting the boot loader password will require that anyone rebooting the system must enter
a password before being able to set command line boot parameters
Rationale:
Requiring a boot password upon execution of the boot loader will prevent an unauthorized
user from entering boot parameters or changing the boot partition. This prevents users
from weakening security (e.g. turning off SELinux at boot time).
Audit:
Run the following commands and verify output matches:
# grep "^set superusers" /boot/grub/grub.cfg
set superusers="<username>"
# grep "^password" /boot/grub/grub.cfg
password_pbkdf2 <username> <encrypted-password>

Remediation:
Create an encrypted password with grub-mkpasswd-pbkdf2:
# grub-mkpasswd-pbkdf2
Enter password: <password>
Reenter password: <password>
Your PBKDF2 is <encrypted-password>

Add the following into /etc/grub.d/00_header or a custom /etc/grub.d configuration file:
cat <<EOF
set superusers="<username>"
password_pbkdf2 <username> <encrypted-password>
EOF

Run the following command to update the grub2 configuration:
# update-grub
