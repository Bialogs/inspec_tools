-a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S mount -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=4294967295 -k mounts

For 64 bit systems add the following lines to the /etc/audit/audit.rules file:
-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S mount -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=4294967295 -k mounts
-a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S mount -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=4294967295 -k mounts

Notes:
This tracks successful and unsuccessful mount commands. File system mounts do not have
to come from external media and this action still does not verify write (e.g. CD ROMS).
