1.1.1.4 Ensure mounting of hfs filesystems is disabled (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
The hfs filesystem type is a hierarchical filesystem that allows you to mount Mac OS
filesystems.
Rationale:
Removing support for unneeded filesystem types reduces the local attack surface of the
system. If this filesystem type is not needed, disable it.
Audit:
Run the following commands and verify the output is as indicated:
# modprobe -n -v hfs
install /bin/true
# lsmod | grep hfs
<No output>

Remediation:
Edit or create the file /etc/modprobe.d/CIS.conf and add the following line:
install hfs /bin/true
