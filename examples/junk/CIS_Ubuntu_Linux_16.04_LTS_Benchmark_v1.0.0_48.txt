1.2 Configure Software Updates
Ubuntu Linux uses apt to install and update software packages. Patch management
procedures may vary widely between enterprises. Large enterprises may choose to install a
local updates server that can be used in place of Ubuntu's servers, whereas a single
deployment of a system may prefer to get updates directly. Updates can be performed
automatically or manually, depending on the site's policy for patch management. Many
large enterprises prefer to test patches on a non-production system before rolling out to
production.
For the purpose of this benchmark, the requirement is to ensure that a patch management
system is configured and maintained. The specifics on patch update procedures are left to
the organization.

1.2.1 Ensure package manager repositories are configured (Not Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
Systems need to have package manager repositories configured to ensure they receive the
latest patches and updates.
Rationale:
If a system's package repositories are misconfigured important patches may not be
identified or a rogue repository could introduce compromised software.
Audit:
Run the following command and verify package repositories are configured correctly:
# apt-cache policy

Remediation:
Configure your package manager repositories according to site policy.
