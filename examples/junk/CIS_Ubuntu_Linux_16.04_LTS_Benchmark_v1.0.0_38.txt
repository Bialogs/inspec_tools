1.1.13 Ensure nodev option set on /home partition (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
The nodev mount option specifies that the filesystem cannot contain special devices.
Rationale:
Since the user partitions are not intended to support devices, set this option to ensure that
users cannot attempt to create block or character special devices.
Audit:
If a /home partition exists run the following command and verify that the nodev option is set
on /home.
# mount | grep /home
/dev/xvdf1 on /home type ext4 (rw,nodev,relatime,data=ordered)

Remediation:
Edit the /etc/fstab file and add nodev to the fourth field (mounting options) for the
/home partition. See the fstab(5) manual page for more information.
# mount -o remount,nodev /home

Notes:
The actions in this recommendation refer to the /home partition, which is the default user
partition that is defined in many distributions. If you have created other user partitions, it
is recommended that the Remediation and Audit steps be applied to these partitions as
well.
