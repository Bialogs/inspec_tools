3.5 Uncommon Network Protocols
The Linux kernel modules support several network protocols that are not commonly used.
If these protocols are not needed, it is recommended that they be disabled in the kernel.

Note: This should not be considered a comprehensive list of uncommon network protocols,
you may wish to consider additions to those listed here for your environment.

3.5.1 Ensure DCCP is disabled (Not Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
The Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP) is a transport layer protocol that
supports streaming media and telephony. DCCP provides a way to gain access to
congestion control, without having to do it at the application layer, but does not provide insequence delivery.
Rationale:
If the protocol is not required, it is recommended that the drivers not be installed
to reduce the potential attack surface.
Audit:
Run the following commands and verify the output is as indicated:
# modprobe -n -v dccp
install /bin/true
# lsmod | grep dccp
<No output>

Remediation:
Edit or create the file /etc/modprobe.d/CIS.conf and add the following line:
install dccp /bin/true
