3.3.2 Ensure IPv6 redirects are not accepted (Not Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
This setting prevents the system from accepting ICMP redirects. ICMP redirects tell the
system about alternate routes for sending traffic.
Rationale:
It is recommended that systems not accept ICMP redirects as they could be tricked into
routing traffic to compromised machines. Setting hard routes within the system (usually a
single default route to a trusted router) protects the system from bad routes.
Audit:
Run the following commands and verify output matches:
# sysctl net.ipv6.conf.all.accept_redirects
net.ipv6.conf.all.accept_redirect = 0
# sysctl net.ipv6.conf.default.accept_redirects
net.ipv6.conf.default.accept_redirect = 0

Remediation:
Set the following parameters in the /etc/sysctl.conf file:
net.ipv6.conf.all.accept_redirects = 0
net.ipv6.conf.default.accept_redirects = 0

Run the following commands to set the active kernel parameters:
# sysctl -w net.ipv6.conf.all.accept_redirects=0
# sysctl -w net.ipv6.conf.default.accept_redirects=0
# sysctl -w net.ipv6.route.flush=1
