4.3 Ensure logrotate is configured (Not Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
The system includes the capability of rotating log files regularly to avoid filling up the
system with logs or making the logs unmanageable large. The file
/etc/logrotate.d/syslog is the configuration file used to rotate log files created by
syslog or rsyslog.
Rationale:
By keeping the log files smaller and more manageable, a system administrator can easily
archive these files to another system and spend less time looking through inordinately
large log files.
Audit:
Review /etc/logrotate.conf and /etc/logrotate.d/* and verify logs are rotated
according to site policy.
Remediation:
Edit /etc/logrotate.conf and /etc/logrotate.d/* to ensure logs are rotated according
to site policy.
