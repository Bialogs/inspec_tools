3.4.3 Ensure /etc/hosts.deny is configured (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
The /etc/hosts.deny file specifies which IP addresses are not permitted to connect to the
host. It is intended to be used in conjunction with the /etc/hosts.allow file.
Rationale:
The /etc/hosts.deny file serves as a failsafe so that any host not specified in
/etc/hosts.allow is denied access to the system.
Audit:
Run the following command and verify the contents of the /etc/hosts.deny file:
# cat /etc/hosts.deny
ALL: ALL

Remediation:
Run the following command to create /etc/hosts.deny:
# echo "ALL: ALL" >> /etc/hosts.deny

Notes:
Contents of the /etc/hosts.deny file may include additional options depending on your
network configuration.
