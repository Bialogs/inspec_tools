1.7.2 Ensure GDM login banner is configured (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
GDM is the GNOME Display Manager which handles graphical login for GNOME based
systems.
Rationale:
Warning messages inform users who are attempting to login to the system of their legal
status regarding the system and must include the name of the organization that owns the
system and any monitoring policies that are in place.
Audit:
If GDM is installed on the system verify that /etc/dconf/profile/gdm exists and contains
the following:
user-db:user
system-db:gdm
file-db:/usr/share/gdm/greeter-dconf-defaults

Then verify the banner-message-enable and banner-message-text options are configured
in /etc/dconf/db/gdm.d/01-banner-message:
[org/gnome/login-screen]
banner-message-enable=true
banner-message-text='<banner message>'

Remediation:
Create the /etc/dconf/profile/gdm file with the following contents:
user-db:user
system-db:gdm
file-db:/usr/share/gdm/greeter-dconf-defaults

Create or edit the banner-message-enable and banner-message-text options
in /etc/dconf/db/gdm.d/01-banner-message:
[org/gnome/login-screen]
banner-message-enable=true
banner-message-text='Authorized uses only. All activity may be monitored and
reported.'
