1.1.10 Ensure separate partition exists for /var/log (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 2 - Server
 Level 2 - Workstation
Description:
The /var/log directory is used by system services to store log data .
Rationale:
There are two important reasons to ensure that system logs are stored on a separate
partition: protection against resource exhaustion (since logs can grow quite large) and
protection of audit data.
Audit:
Run the following command and verify output shows /var/log is mounted:
# mount | grep /var/log
/dev/xvdh1 on /var/log type ext4 (rw,relatime,data=ordered)

Remediation:
For new installations, during installation create a custom partition setup and specify a
separate partition for /var/log.
For systems that were previously installed, create a new partition and
configure /etc/fstab as appropriate.
Impact:
Resizing filesystems is a common activity in cloud-hosted servers. Separate filesystem
partitions may prevent successful resizing, or may require the installation of additional
tools solely for the purpose of resizing operations. The use of these additional tools may
introduce their own security considerations.
