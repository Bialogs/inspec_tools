3.2 Network Parameters (Host and Router)
The following network parameters are intended for use on both host only and router
systems. A system acts as a router if it has at least two interfaces and is configured to
perform routing functions.

3.2.1 Ensure source routed packets are not accepted (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
In networking, source routing allows a sender to partially or fully specify the route packets
take through a network. In contrast, non-source routed packets travel a path determined
by routers in the network. In some cases, systems may not be routable or reachable from
some locations (e.g. private addresses vs. Internet routable), and so source routed packets
would need to be used.
Rationale:
Setting net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_source_route and
net.ipv4.conf.default.accept_source_route to 0 disables the system from accepting
source routed packets. Assume this system was capable of routing packets to Internet
routable addresses on one interface and private addresses on another interface. Assume
that the private addresses were not routable to the Internet routable addresses and vice
versa. Under normal routing circumstances, an attacker from the Internet routable
addresses could not use the system as a way to reach the private address systems. If,
however, source routed packets were allowed, they could be used to gain access to the
private address systems as the route could be specified, rather than rely on routing
protocols that did not allow this routing.
Audit:
Run the following commands and verify output matches:
# sysctl net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_source_route
net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_source_route = 0
# sysctl net.ipv4.conf.default.accept_source_route
net.ipv4.conf.default.accept_source_route = 0
