Description:
Wireless networking is used when wired networks are unavailable. Ubuntu contains a
wireless tool kit to allow system administrators to configure and use wireless networks.
Rationale:
If wireless is not to be used, wireless devices can be disabled to reduce the potential attack

Audit:
Run the following command to determine wireless interfaces on the system:
