6.2.6 Ensure root PATH Integrity (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
The root user can execute any command on the system and could be fooled into executing
programs unintentionally if the PATH is not set correctly.
Rationale:
Including the current working directory (.) or other writable directory in root's executable
path makes it likely that an attacker can gain superuser access by forcing an administrator
operating as root to execute a Trojan horse program.
Audit:
Run the following script and verify no results are returned:
#!/bin/bash
if [ "`echo $PATH | grep :: `" != "" ]; then
echo "Empty Directory in PATH (::)"
fi
if [ "`echo $PATH | grep :$`"
echo "Trailing : in PATH"
fi

!= "" ]; then

p=`echo $PATH | sed -e 's/::/:/' -e 's/:$//' -e 's/:/ /g'`
set -- $p
while [ "$1" != "" ]; do
if [ "$1" = "." ]; then
echo "PATH contains ."
shift
continue
fi
if [ -d $1 ]; then
dirperm=`ls -ldH $1 | cut -f1 -d" "`
if [ `echo $dirperm | cut -c6 ` != "-" ]; then
echo "Group Write permission set on directory $1"
fi
if [ `echo $dirperm | cut -c9 ` != "-" ]; then
echo "Other Write permission set on directory $1"
fi
dirown=`ls -ldH $1 | awk '{print $3}'`
if [ "$dirown" != "root" ] ; then
echo $1 is not owned by root
fi
else
echo $1 is not a directory
