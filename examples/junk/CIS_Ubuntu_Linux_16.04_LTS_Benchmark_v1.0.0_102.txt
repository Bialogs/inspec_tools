2.2.1.3 Ensure chrony is configured (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
chrony is a daemon which implements the Network Time Protocol (NTP) is designed to

synchronize system clocks across a variety of systems and use a source that is highly
accurate. More information on chrony can be found
at http://chrony.tuxfamily.org/. chrony can be configured to be a client and/or a server.
Rationale:
If chrony is in use on the system proper configuration is vital to ensuring time
synchronization is working properly.

This recommendation only applies if chrony is in use on the system.
Audit:
Run the following command and verify remote server is configured properly:
# grep "^server" /etc/chrony/chrony.conf
server <remote-server>

Multiple servers may be configured.
Run the following command and verify the first field for the chronyd process is _chrony:
# ps -ef | grep chronyd
_chrony
491
1 0 20:32 ?

00:00:00 /usr/sbin/chronyd

Remediation:
Add or edit server lines to /etc/chrony/chrony.conf as appropriate:
server <remote-server>

Configure chrony to run as the chrony user by configuring the appropriate startup script
for your distribution. Startup scripts are typically stored in /etc/init.d or /etc/systemd.
