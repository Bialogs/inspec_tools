5.2.14 Ensure SSH access is limited (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
There are several options available to limit which users and group can access the system
via SSH. It is recommended that at least one of the following options be leveraged:
AllowUsers

The AllowUsers variable gives the system administrator the option of allowing specific
users to ssh into the system. The list consists of comma separated user names. Numeric
user IDs are not recognized with this variable. If a system administrator wants to restrict
user access further by only allowing the allowed users to log in from a particular host, the
entry can be specified in the form of user@host.
AllowGroups

The AllowGroups variable gives the system administrator the option of allowing specific
groups of users to ssh into the system. The list consists of comma separated group names.
Numeric group IDs are not recognized with this variable.
DenyUsers

The DenyUsers variable gives the system administrator the option of denying specific
users to ssh into the system. The list consists of comma separated user names. Numeric
user IDs are not recognized with this variable. If a system administrator wants to restrict
user access further by specifically denying a user's access from a particular host, the entry
can be specified in the form of user@host.
DenyGroups

The DenyGroups variable gives the system administrator the option of denying specific
groups of users to ssh into the system. The list consists of comma separated group names.
Numeric group IDs are not recognized with this variable.
Rationale:
Restricting which users can remotely access the system via SSH will help ensure that only
authorized users access the system.
