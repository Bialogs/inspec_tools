2.2.4 Ensure CUPS is not enabled (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 2 - Workstation
Description:
The Common Unix Print System (CUPS) provides the ability to print to both local and
network printers. A system running CUPS can also accept print jobs from remote systems
and print them to local printers. It also provides a web based remote administration
capability.
Rationale:
If the system does not need to print jobs or accept print jobs from other systems, it is
recommended that CUPS be disabled to reduce the potential attack surface.
Audit:
Run the following command to verify cups is not enabled:
# systemctl is-enabled cups
disabled

Verify result is not "enabled".
Remediation:
Run the following command to disable cups:
# systemctl disable cups

Impact:
Disabling CUPS will prevent printing from the system, a common task for workstation
systems.
