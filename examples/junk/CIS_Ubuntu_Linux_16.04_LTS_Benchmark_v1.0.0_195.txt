4.2.2 Configure syslog-ng
The syslog-ng software is recommended as a replacement for the syslogd daemon and
provides improvements over syslogd, such as connection-oriented (i.e. TCP) transmission
of logs, the option to log to database formats, and the encryption of log data en route to a
central logging server.
Note: This section only applies if syslog-ng is installed on the system.

4.2.2.1 Ensure syslog-ng service is enabled (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
Once the syslog-ng package is installed it needs to be activated.
Rationale:
If the syslog-ng service is not activated the system may default to the syslogd service or
lack logging instead.
Audit:
Run the following command to verify syslog-ng is enabled:
# systemctl is-enabled syslog-ng
enabled

Verify result is "enabled".
Remediation:
Run the following command to enable syslog-ng:
# update-rc.d syslog-ng enable
