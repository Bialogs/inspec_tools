4.1.15 Ensure changes to system administration scope (sudoers) is
collected (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 2 - Server
 Level 2 - Workstation
Description:
Monitor scope changes for system administrations. If the system has been properly
configured to force system administrators to log in as themselves first and then use the
sudo command to execute privileged commands, it is possible to monitor changes in scope.
The file /etc/sudoers will be written to when the file or its attributes have changed. The
audit records will be tagged with the identifier "scope."
Rationale:
Changes in the /etc/sudoers file can indicate that an unauthorized change has been made
to scope of system administrator activity.
Audit:
Run the following command and verify output matches:
# grep scope /etc/audit/audit.rules
-w /etc/sudoers -p wa -k scope
-w /etc/sudoers.d -p wa -k scope

Remediation:
Add the following line to the /etc/audit/audit.rules file:
-w /etc/sudoers -p wa -k scope
-w /etc/sudoers.d -p wa -k scope
