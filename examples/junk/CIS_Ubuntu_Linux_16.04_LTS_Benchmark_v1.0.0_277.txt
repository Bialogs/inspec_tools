6.2.10 Ensure users' dot files are not group or world writable (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
While the system administrator can establish secure permissions for users' "dot" files, the
users can easily override these.
Rationale:
Group or world-writable user configuration files may enable malicious users to steal or
modify other users' data or to gain another user's system privileges.
Audit:
Run the following script and verify no results are returned:
#!/bin/bash
for dir in `cat /etc/passwd | egrep -v '(root|sync|halt|shutdown)' | awk -F: '($7 !=
"/usr/sbin/nologin") { print $6 }'`; do
for file in $dir/.[A-Za-z0-9]*; do
if [ ! -h "$file" -a -f "$file" ]; then
fileperm=`ls -ld $file | cut -f1 -d" "`
if [ `echo $fileperm | cut -c6
echo "Group Write permission
fi
if [ `echo $fileperm | cut -c9
echo "Other Write permission
fi
fi
done
done

` != "-" ]; then
set on file $file"
` != "-" ]; then
set on file $file"

Remediation:
Making global modifications to users' files without alerting the user community can result
in unexpected outages and unhappy users. Therefore, it is recommended that a monitoring
policy be established to report user dot file permissions and determine the action to be
taken in accordance with site policy.
