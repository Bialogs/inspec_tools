4.2.1 Configure rsyslog
The rsyslog software is recommended as a replacement for the syslogd daemon and
provides improvements over syslogd, such as connection-oriented (i.e. TCP) transmission
of logs, the option to log to database formats, and the encryption of log data en route to a
central logging server.
Note: This section only applies if rsyslog is installed on the system.

4.2.1.1 Ensure rsyslog Service is enabled (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
Once the rsyslog package is installed it needs to be activated.
Rationale:
If the rsyslog service is not activated the system may default to the syslogd service or lack
logging instead.
Audit:
Run the following command to verify rsyslog is enabled:
# systemctl is-enabled rsyslog
enabled

Verify result is "enabled".
Remediation:
Run the following command to enable rsyslog:
# systemctl enable rsyslog
