1.8 Ensure updates, patches, and additional security software are
installed (Not Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
Periodically patches are released for included software either due to security flaws or to
include additional functionality.
Rationale:
Newer patches may contain security enhancements that would not be available through the
latest full update. As a result, it is recommended that the latest software patches be used to
take advantage of the latest functionality. As with any software installation, organizations
need to determine if a given update meets their requirements and verify the compatibility
and supportability of any additional software against the update revision that is selected.
Audit:
Run the following command and verify there are no updates or patches to install:
# apt-get -s upgrade

Remediation:
Use your package manager to update all packages on the system according to site policy.
Notes:
Site policy may mandate a testing period before install onto production systems for
available updates.

2 Services
While applying system updates and patches helps correct known vulnerabilities, one of the
best ways to protect the system against as yet unreported vulnerabilities is to disable all
services that are not required for normal system operation. This prevents the exploitation
of vulnerabilities discovered at a later date. If a service is not enabled, it cannot be
exploited. The actions in this section of the document provide guidance on some services
