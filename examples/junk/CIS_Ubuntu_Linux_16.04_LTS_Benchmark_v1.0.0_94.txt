2.1.6 Ensure rsh server is not enabled (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
The Berkeley rsh-server (rsh, rlogin, rexec) package contains legacy services that
exchange credentials in clear-text.
Rationale:
These legacy services contain numerous security exposures and have been replaced with
the more secure SSH package.
Audit:
Verify the rsh services are not enabled. Run the following commands and verify results are
as indicated:
grep -R "^shell" /etc/inetd.*
grep -R "^login" /etc/inetd.*
grep -R "^exec" /etc/inetd.*

No results should be returned
check /etc/xinetd.conf and /etc/xinetd.d/* and verify all rsh, rlogin, and
rexec services have disable = yes set.
Remediation:
Comment out or remove any lines starting with shell, login, or
exec from /etc/inetd.conf and /etc/inetd.d/*.
Set disable = yes on all rsh, rlogin,
and rexec services in /etc/xinetd.conf and /etc/xinetd.d/*.
