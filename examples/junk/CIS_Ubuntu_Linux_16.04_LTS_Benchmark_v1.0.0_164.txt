4.1.3 Ensure auditing for processes that start prior to auditd is enabled
(Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 2 - Server
 Level 2 - Workstation
Description:
Configure grub so that processes that are capable of being audited can be audited even if
they start up prior to auditd startup.
Rationale:
Audit events need to be captured on processes that start up prior to auditd, so that
potential malicious activity cannot go undetected.
Audit:
Run the following command and verify that each linux line has the audit=1 parameter set:
# grep "^\s*linux" /boot/grub/grub.cfg

Remediation:
Edit /etc/default/grub and add audit=1 to GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX:
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="audit=1"

Run the following command to update the grub2 configuration:
# update-grub

Notes:
This recommendation is designed around the grub bootloader, if LILO or another
bootloader is in use in your environment enact equivalent settings.
