1.5.2 Ensure XD/NX support is enabled (Not Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
Recent processors in the x86 family support the ability to prevent code execution on a per
memory page basis. Generically and on AMD processors, this ability is called No Execute
(NX), while on Intel processors it is called Execute Disable (XD). This ability can help
prevent exploitation of buffer overflow vulnerabilities and should be activated whenever
possible. Extra steps must be taken to ensure that this protection is enabled, particularly on
32-bit x86 systems. Other processors, such as Itanium and POWER, have included such
support since inception and the standard kernel for those platforms supports the feature.
Rationale:
Enabling any feature that can protect against buffer overflow attacks enhances the security
of the system.

Audit:
Run the following command and verify your kernel has identified and activated NX/XD
protection.
# dmesg | grep NX
NX (Execute Disable) protection: active

Remediation:
On 32 bit systems install a kernel with PAE support, no installation is required on 64 bit
systems:
If necessary configure your bootloader to load the new kernel and reboot the system.
You may need to enable NX or XD support in your bios.
