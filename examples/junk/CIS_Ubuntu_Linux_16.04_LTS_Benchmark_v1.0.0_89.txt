services should be disabled if possible.

are as indicated:
grep -R "^chargen" /etc/inetd.*

No results should be returned
check /etc/xinetd.conf and /etc/xinetd.d/* and verify all chargen services have
disable = yes set.
Remediation:
Comment out or remove any lines starting with chargen from /etc/inetd.conf and
/etc/inetd.d/*.
Set disable = yes on all chargen services in /etc/xinetd.conf and /etc/xinetd.d/*.
