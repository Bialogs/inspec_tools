2.2.7 Ensure NFS and RPC are not enabled (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
The Network File System (NFS) is one of the first and most widely distributed file systems
in the UNIX environment. It provides the ability for systems to mount file systems of other
servers through the network.
Rationale:
If the system does not export NFS shares or act as an NFS client, it is recommended that
these services be disabled to reduce remote attack surface.
Audit:
Run the following command to verify nfs is not enabled:
# systemctl is-enabled nfs-kernel-server
disabled

Verify result is not "enabled".

Run the following command to verify rpcbind is not enabled:
# systemctl is-enabled rpcbind
disabled

Verify result is not "enabled".
Remediation:
Run the following commands to disable nfs and rpcbind:
# systemctl disable nfs-kernel-server
# systemctl disable rpcbind
