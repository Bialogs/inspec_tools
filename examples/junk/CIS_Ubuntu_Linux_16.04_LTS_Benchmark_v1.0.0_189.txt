4.2.1.2 Ensure logging is configured (Not Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
The /etc/rsyslog.conf file specifies rules for logging and which files are to be used to log
certain classes of messages.
Rationale:
A great deal of important security-related information is sent via rsyslog (e.g., successful
and failed su attempts, failed login attempts, root login attempts, etc.).
Audit:
Review the contents of the /etc/rsyslog.conf file to ensure appropriate logging is set. In
addition, run the following command and verify that the log files are logging information:
# ls -l /var/log/

Remediation:
Edit the following lines in the /etc/rsyslog.conf file as appropriate for your
environment:
*.emerg
mail.*
mail.info
mail.warning
mail.err
news.crit
news.err
news.notice
*.=warning;*.=err
*.crit
*.*;mail.none;news.none
local0,local1.*
local2,local3.*
local4,local5.*
local6,local7.*

:omusrmsg:*
-/var/log/mail
-/var/log/mail.info
-/var/log/mail.warn
/var/log/mail.err
-/var/log/news/news.crit
-/var/log/news/news.err

/var/log/warn
-/var/log/messages
-/var/log/localmessages
-/var/log/localmessages

Run the following command to restart rsyslogd:
# pkill -HUP rsyslogd
