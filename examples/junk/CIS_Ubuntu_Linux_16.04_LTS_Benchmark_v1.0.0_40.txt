1.1.15 Ensure nosuid option set on /dev/shm partition (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
The nosuid mount option specifies that the filesystem cannot contain setuid files.
Rationale:
Setting this option on a file system prevents users from introducing privileged programs
onto the system and allowing non-root users to execute them.
Audit:
Run the following command and verify that the nosuid option is set on /dev/shm.
# mount | grep /dev/shm
tmpfs on /dev/shm type tmpfs (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime)

Remediation:
Edit the /etc/fstab file and add nosuid to the fourth field (mounting options) for
the /dev/shm partition. See the fstab(5) manual page for more information.
Run the following command to remount /dev/shm:
# mount -o remount,nosuid /dev/shm
