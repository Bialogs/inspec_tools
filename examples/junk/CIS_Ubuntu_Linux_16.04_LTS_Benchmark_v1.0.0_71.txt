AppArmor must be enabled at boot time in your bootloader configuration to ensure that
the controls it provides are not overridden.
Audit:
Run the following command and verify that no linux line the apparmor=0 parameter set:
# grep "^\s*linux" /boot/grub/grub.cfg

Remediation:
Edit /etc/default/grub and remove all instances of apparmor=0 from all CMDLINE_LINUX
parameters:
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet"
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=""

Run the following command to update the grub2 configuration:
# update-grub

Notes:
This recommendation is designed around the grub bootloader, if LILO or another
bootloader is in use in your environment enact equivalent settings.
