2.3.2 Ensure rsh client is not installed (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
The rsh package contains the client commands for the rsh services.
Rationale:
These legacy clients contain numerous security exposures and have been replaced with the
more secure SSH package. Even if the server is removed, it is best to ensure the clients are
also removed to prevent users from inadvertently attempting to use these commands and
therefore exposing their credentials. Note that removing the rsh package removes the
clients for rsh, rcp and rlogin.
Audit:
Run the following commands and verify rsh is not installed:
dpkg -s rsh-client
dpkg -s rsh-redone-client

Remediation:
Run the following command to uninstall rsh:
apt-get remove rsh-client rsh-redone-client

Impact:
Many insecure service clients are used as troubleshooting tools and in testing
environments. Uninstalling them can inhibit capability to test and troubleshoot. If they are
required it is advisable to remove the clients after use to prevent accidental or intentional
misuse.
