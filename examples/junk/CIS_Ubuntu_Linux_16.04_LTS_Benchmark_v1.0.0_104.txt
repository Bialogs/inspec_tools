2.2.3 Ensure Avahi Server is not enabled (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
Avahi is a free zeroconf implementation, including a system for multicast DNS/DNS-SD
service discovery. Avahi allows programs to publish and discover services and hosts
running on a local network with no specific configuration. For example, a user can plug a
computer into a network and Avahi automatically finds printers to print to, files to look at
and people to talk to, as well as network services running on the machine.
Rationale:
Automatic discovery of network services is not normally required for system
functionality. It is recommended to disable the service to reduce the potential attach
surface.
Audit:
Run the following command to verify avahi-daemon is not enabled:
# systemctl is-enabled avahi-daemon
disabled

Verify result is not "enabled".
Remediation:
Run the following command to disable avahi-daemon:
# systemctl disable avahi-daemon
