2.1.10 Ensure xinetd is not enabled (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
The eXtended InterNET Daemon (xinetd) is an open source super daemon that replaced
the original inetd daemon. The xinetd daemon listens for well known services and
dispatches the appropriate daemon to properly respond to service requests.
Rationale:
If there are no xinetd services required, it is recommended that the daemon be disabled.
Audit:
Run the following command to verify xinetd is not enabled:
# systemctl is-enabled xinetd
disabled

Verify result is not "enabled".
Remediation:
Run the following command to disable xinetd:
# systemctl disable xinetd

Notes:
Additional methods of disabling a service exist. Consult your distribution documentation
for appropriate methods.

2.2 Special Purpose Services
This section describes services that are installed on systems that specifically need to run
these services. If any of these services are not required, it is recommended that they be
disabled or deleted from the system to reduce the potential attack surface.
