The audit and remediation in this recommendation apply to bash and shell. If other shells
are supported on the system, it is recommended that their configuration files also are
checked.
Other methods of setting a default user umask exist however the shell configuration files
are the last run and will override other settings if they exist therefore our recommendation
is to configure in the shell configuration files. If other methods are in use in your
environment they should be audited and the shell configs should be verified to not
override.
