1.1.16 Ensure noexec option set on /dev/shm partition (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
The noexec mount option specifies that the filesystem cannot contain executable binaries.
Rationale:
Setting this option on a file system prevents users from executing programs from shared
memory. This deters users from introducing potentially malicious software on the system.
Audit:
Run the following command and verify that the noexec option is set on /run/shm.
# mount | grep /dev/shm
tmpfs on /dev/shm type tmpfs (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime)

Remediation:
Edit the /etc/fstab file and add noexec to the fourth field (mounting options) for
the /dev/shm partition. See the fstab(5) manual page for more information.
Run the following command to remount /dev/shm:
# mount -o remount,noexec /dev/shm
