1.1.1.7 Ensure mounting of udf filesystems is disabled (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
The udf filesystem type is the universal disk format used to implement ISO/IEC 13346 and
ECMA-167 specifications. This is an open vendor filesystem type for data storage on a
broad range of media. This filesystem type is necessary to support writing DVDs and newer
optical disc formats.
Rationale:
Removing support for unneeded filesystem types reduces the local attack surface of the
system. If this filesystem type is not needed, disable it.
Audit:
Run the following commands and verify the output is as indicated:
# modprobe -n -v udf
install /bin/true
# lsmod | grep udf
<No output>

Remediation:
Edit or create the file /etc/modprobe.d/CIS.conf and add the following line:
install udf /bin/true
