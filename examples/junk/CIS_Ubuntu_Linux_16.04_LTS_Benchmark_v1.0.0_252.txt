This section provides guidance on securing aspects of system files and directories.

6.1.1 Audit system file permissions (Not Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 2 - Server
 Level 2 - Workstation
Description:
The Debian package manager has a number of useful options. One of these, the -verify option, can be used to verify that system packages are correctly installed. The -verify option can be used to verify a particular package or to verify all system packages. If
no output is returned, the package is installed correctly. The following table describes the
meaning of output from the verify option:
Code
S
M
5
D
L
U
G
T

Meaning
File size differs.
File mode differs (includes permissions and file type).
The MD5 checksum differs.
The major and minor version numbers differ on a device file.
A mismatch occurs in a link.
The file ownership differs.
The file group owner differs.
The file time (mtime) differs.

The dpkg -S command can be used to determine which package a particular file belongs to.
For example the following commands determines which package the /bin/bash file
belongs to:
# dpkg -S /bin/bash
bash: /bin/bash

To verify the settings for the package that controls the /bin/bash file, run the following:
# dpkg --verify bash
??5?????? c /etc/bash.bashrc

Rationale:
It is important to confirm that packaged system files and directories are maintained with
the permissions they were intended to have from the OS vendor.
