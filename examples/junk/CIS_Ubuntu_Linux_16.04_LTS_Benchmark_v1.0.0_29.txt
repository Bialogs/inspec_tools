1.1.4 Ensure nosuid option set on /tmp partition (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
The nosuid mount option specifies that the filesystem cannot contain setuid files.
Rationale:
Since the /tmp filesystem is only intended for temporary file storage, set this option to
ensure that users cannot create setuid files in /tmp.
Audit:
If a /tmp partition exists run the following command and verify that the nosuid option is set
on /tmp:
# mount | grep /tmp
tmpfs on /tmp type tmpfs (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime)

Remediation:
Edit the /etc/fstab file and add nosuid to the fourth field (mounting options) for
the /tmp partition. See the fstab(5) manual page for more information.
Run the following command to remount /tmp:
# mount -o remount,nosuid /tmp

Notes:
systemd includes the tmp.mount service which should be used instead of
configuring /etc/fstab. Mounting options are configured in the Options setting
in /etc/systemd/system/tmp.mount.
