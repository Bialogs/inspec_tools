1.1.1.6 Ensure mounting of squashfs filesystems is disabled (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
The squashfs filesystem type is a compressed read-only Linux filesystem embedded in
small footprint systems (similar to cramfs). A squashfs image can be used without having
to first decompress the image.
Rationale:
Removing support for unneeded filesystem types reduces the local attack surface of the
system. If this filesystem type is not needed, disable it.
Audit:
Run the following commands and verify the output is as indicated:
# modprobe -n -v squashfs
install /bin/true
# lsmod | grep squashfs
<No output>

Remediation:
Edit or create the file /etc/modprobe.d/CIS.conf and add the following line:
install squashfs /bin/true
