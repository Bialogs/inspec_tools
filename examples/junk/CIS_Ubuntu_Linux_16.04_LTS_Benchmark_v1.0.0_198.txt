4.2.2.3 Ensure syslog-ng default file permissions configured (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
syslog-ng will create logfiles that do not already exist on the system. This setting controls
what permissions will be applied to these newly created files.
Rationale:
It is important to ensure that log files exist and have the correct permissions to ensure that
sensitive syslog-ng data is archived and protected.
Audit:
Run the following command and verify the perm option is 0640 or more restrictive:
# grep ^options /etc/syslog-ng/syslog-ng.conf
options { chain_hostnames(off); flush_lines(0); perm(0640); stats_freq(3600);
threaded(yes); };

Remediation:
Edit the /etc/syslog-ng/syslog-ng.conf and set perm option to 0640 or more restrictive:
options { chain_hostnames(off); flush_lines(0); perm(0640); stats_freq(3600);
threaded(yes); };
