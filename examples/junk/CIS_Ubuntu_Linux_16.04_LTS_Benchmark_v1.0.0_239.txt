5.4.1 Set Shadow Password Suite Parameters
While a majority of the password control parameters have been moved to PAM, some
parameters are still available through the shadow password suite. Any changes made to
/etc/login.defs will only be applied if the usermod command is used. If user IDs are
added a different way, use the chage command to effect changes to individual user IDs.

5.4.1.1 Ensure password expiration is 90 days or less (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
The PASS_MAX_DAYS parameter in /etc/login.defs allows an administrator to force
passwords to expire once they reach a defined age. It is recommended that the
PASS_MAX_DAYS parameter be set to less than or equal to 90 days.
Rationale:
The window of opportunity for an attacker to leverage compromised credentials or
successfully compromise credentials via an online brute force attack is limited by the age of
the password. Therefore, reducing the maximum age of a password also reduces an
attacker's window of opportunity.
Audit:
Run the following command and verify PASS_MAX_DAYS is 90 or less:
# grep PASS_MAX_DAYS /etc/login.defs
PASS_MAX_DAYS 90

Verify all users with a password have their maximum days between password change set
to 90 or less:
# egrep ^[^:]+:[^\!*] /etc/shadow | cut -d: -f1
<list of users>
# chage --list <user>
Maximum number of days between password change

: 90

Remediation:
Set the PASS_MAX_DAYS parameter to 90 in /etc/login.defs:
