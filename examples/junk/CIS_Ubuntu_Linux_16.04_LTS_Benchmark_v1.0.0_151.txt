3.6.2 Ensure default deny firewall policy (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
A default deny all policy on connections ensures that any unconfigured network usage will
be rejected.
Rationale:
With a default accept policy the firewall will accept any packet that is not configured to be
denied. It is easier to white list acceptable usage than to black list unacceptable usage.
Audit:
Run the following command and verify that the policy for the INPUT, OUTPUT, and FORWARD
chains is DROP or REJECT:
# iptables -L
Chain INPUT (policy DROP)
Chain FORWARD (policy DROP)
Chain OUTPUT (policy DROP)

Remediation:
Run the following commands to implement a default DROP policy:
# iptables -P INPUT DROP
# iptables -P OUTPUT DROP
# iptables -P FORWARD DROP

Notes:
Changing firewall settings while connected over network can result in being locked out of
the system.
Remediation will only affect the active system firewall, be sure to configure the default
policy in your firewall management to apply on boot as well.
