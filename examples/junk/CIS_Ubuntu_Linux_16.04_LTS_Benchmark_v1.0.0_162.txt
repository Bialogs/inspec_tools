4.1.1.3 Ensure audit logs are not automatically deleted (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 2 - Server
 Level 2 - Workstation
Description:
The max_log_file_action setting determines how to handle the audit log file reaching the
max file size. A value of keep_logs will rotate the logs but never delete old logs.
Rationale:
In high security contexts, the benefits of maintaining a long audit history exceed the cost of
storing the audit history.
Audit:
Run the following command and verify output matches:
# grep max_log_file_action /etc/audit/auditd.conf
max_log_file_action = keep_logs

Remediation:
Set the following parameter in /etc/audit/auditd.conf:
max_log_file_action = keep_logs
