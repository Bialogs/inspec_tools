multiple windows in which to run programs and various add on. The X Windows system is
typically used on workstations where users login, but not on servers where users typically
do not login.
Rationale:
Unless your organization specifically requires graphical login access via X Windows,
remove it to reduce the potential attack surface.
Audit:
Run the following command and verify X Windows System is not installed:
dpkg -l xserver-xorg*

Remediation:
Run the following command to remove the X Windows System packages:
apt-get remove xserver-xorg*
