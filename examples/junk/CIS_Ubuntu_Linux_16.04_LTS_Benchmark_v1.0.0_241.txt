5.4.1.2 Ensure minimum days between password changes is 7 or more
(Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
The PASS_MIN_DAYS parameter in /etc/login.defs allows an administrator to prevent
users from changing their password until a minimum number of days have passed since the
last time the user changed their password. It is recommended that PASS_MIN_DAYS
parameter be set to 7 or more days.
Rationale:
By restricting the frequency of password changes, an administrator can prevent users from
repeatedly changing their password in an attempt to circumvent password reuse controls.
Audit:
Run the following command and verify PASS_MIN_DAYS is 7 or more:
# grep PASS_MIN_DAYS /etc/login.defs
PASS_MIN_DAYS 7

Verify all users with a password have their minimum days between password change set to
7 or more:
# egrep ^[^:]+:[^\!*] /etc/shadow | cut -d: -f1
<list of users>
# chage --list <user>
Minimum number of days between password change

: 7

Remediation:
Set the PASS_MIN_DAYS parameter to 7 in /etc/login.defs:
PASS_MIN_DAYS 7

Modify user parameters for all users with a password set to match:
# chage --mindays 7 <user>
