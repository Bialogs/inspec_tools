4.2.1.4 Ensure rsyslog is configured to send logs to a remote log host
(Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
The rsyslog utility supports the ability to send logs it gathers to a remote log host running
syslogd(8) or to receive messages from remote hosts, reducing administrative overhead.
Rationale:
Storing log data on a remote host protects log integrity from local attacks. If an attacker
gains root access on the local system, they could tamper with or remove log data that is
stored on the local system
Audit:
Review the /etc/rsyslog.conf file and verify that logs are sent to a central host (where
loghost.example.com is the name of your central log host):
# grep "^*.*[^I][^I]*@" /etc/rsyslog.conf
*.* @@loghost.example.com

Remediation:
Edit the /etc/rsyslog.conf file and add the following line (where loghost.example.com is
the name of your central log host).
*.* @@loghost.example.com

Run the following command to restart rsyslog:
# pkill -HUP rsyslogd

References:
1. See the rsyslog.conf(5) man page for more information.
Notes:
The double "at" sign (@@) directs rsyslog to use TCP to send log messages to the server,
which is a more reliable transport mechanism than the default UDP protocol.
