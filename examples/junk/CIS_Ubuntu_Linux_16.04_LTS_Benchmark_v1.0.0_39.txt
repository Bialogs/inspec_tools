1.1.14 Ensure nodev option set on /dev/shm partition (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
The nodev mount option specifies that the filesystem cannot contain special devices.
Rationale:
Since the /run/shm filesystem is not intended to support devices, set this option to ensure
that users cannot attempt to create special devices in /dev/shm partitions.
Audit:
Run the following command and verify that the nodev option is set on /dev/shm.
# mount | grep /dev/shm
tmpfs on /dev/shm type tmpfs (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime)

Remediation:
Edit the /etc/fstab file and add nodev to the fourth field (mounting options) for
the /dev/shm partition. See the fstab(5) manual page for more information.
Run the following command to remount /dev/shm:
# mount -o remount,nodev /dev/shm
