1.6.2.2 Ensure all AppArmor Profiles are enforcing (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 2 - Server
 Level 2 - Workstation
Description:
AppArmor profiles define what resources applications are able to access.
Rationale:
Security configuration requirements vary from site to site. Some sites may mandate a
policy that is stricter than the default policy, which is perfectly acceptable. This item is
intended to ensure that any policies that exist on the system are activated.
Audit:
Run the following command and verify that profiles are loaded, no profiles are in complain
mode, and no processes are unconfined:
# apparmor_status
apparmor module is loaded.
17 profiles are loaded.
17 profiles are in enforce mode.
