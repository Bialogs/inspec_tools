1.1.5 Ensure separate partition exists for /var (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 2 - Server
 Level 2 - Workstation
Description:
The /var directory is used by daemons and other system services to temporarily store
dynamic data. Some directories created by these processes may be world-writable.
Rationale:
Since the /var directory may contain world-writable files and directories, there is a risk of
resource exhaustion if it is not bound to a separate partition.
Audit:
Run the following command and verify output shows /var is mounted:
# mount | grep /var
/dev/xvdg1 on /var type ext4 (rw,relatime,data=ordered)

Remediation:
For new installations, during installation create a custom partition setup and specify a
separate partition for /var.
For systems that were previously installed, create a new partition and
configure /etc/fstab as appropriate.
Impact:
Resizing filesystems is a common activity in cloud-hosted servers. Separate filesystem
partitions may prevent successful resizing, or may require the installation of additional
tools solely for the purpose of resizing operations. The use of these additional tools may
introduce their own security considerations.
