5.3.2 Ensure lockout for failed password attempts is configured (Not
Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
Lock out users after n unsuccessful consecutive login attempts. The first sets of changes are
made to the PAM configuration files. The second set of changes are applied to the program
specific PAM configuration file. The second set of changes must be applied to each program
that will lock out users. Check the documentation for each secondary program for
instructions on how to configure them to work with PAM.
Set the lockout number to the policy in effect at your site.
Rationale:
Locking out user IDs after n unsuccessful consecutive login attempts mitigates brute force
password attacks against your systems.
Audit:
Perform the following to determine the current settings for user lockout.
# grep "pam_tally2" /etc/pam.d/common-auth
auth required pam_tally2.so onerr=fail audit silent deny=5 unlock_time=900

Remediation:
Edit the /etc/pam.d/common-auth file and add the auth line below:
auth required pam_tally2.so onerr=fail audit silent deny=5 unlock_time=900

Note: If a user has been locked out because they have reached the maximum consecutive
failure count defined by deny= in the pam_tally2.so module, the user can be unlocked by
issuing the command /sbin/pam_tally2 -u <username> --reset. This command sets the
failed count to 0, effectively unlocking the user.
