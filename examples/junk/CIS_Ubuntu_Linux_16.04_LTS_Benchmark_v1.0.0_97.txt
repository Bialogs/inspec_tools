2.1.9 Ensure tftp server is not enabled (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) is a simple file transfer protocol, typically used to
automatically transfer configuration or boot machines from a boot server. The packages
tftp and atftp are both used to define and support a TFTP server.
Rationale:
TFTP does not support authentication nor does it ensure the confidentiality or integrity of
data. It is recommended that TFTP be removed, unless there is a specific need for TFTP. In
that case, extreme caution must be used when configuring the services.
Audit:
Verify the tftp service is not enabled. Run the following command and verify results are as
indicated:
grep -R "^tftp" /etc/inetd.*

No results should be returned
check /etc/xinetd.conf and /etc/xinetd.d/* and verify all tftp services have disable
= yes set.
Remediation:
Comment out or remove any lines starting
with tftp from /etc/inetd.conf and /etc/inetd.d/*.
Set disable = yes on all tftp services in /etc/xinetd.conf and /etc/xinetd.d/*.
