1.1.17 Ensure nodev option set on removable media partitions (Not
Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
The nodev mount option specifies that the filesystem cannot contain special devices.
Rationale:
Removable media containing character and block special devices could be used to
circumvent security controls by allowing non-root users to access sensitive device files
such as /dev/kmem or the raw disk partitions.
Audit:
Run the following command and verify that the nodev option is set on all removable media
partitions.
# mount

Remediation:
Edit the /etc/fstab file and add nodev to the fourth field (mounting options) of all
removable media partitions. Look for entries that have mount points that contain words
such as floppy or cdrom. See the fstab(5) manual page for more information.
