6.2.5 Ensure root is the only UID 0 account (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
Any account with UID 0 has superuser privileges on the system.
Rationale:
This access must be limited to only the default root account and only from the system
console. Administrative access must be through an unprivileged account using an approved
mechanism as noted in Item 5.6 Ensure access to the su command is restricted.
Audit:
Run the following command and verify that only "root" is returned:
# cat /etc/passwd | awk -F: '($3 == 0) { print $1 }'
root

Remediation:
Remove any users other than root with UID 0 or assign them a new UID if appropriate.
