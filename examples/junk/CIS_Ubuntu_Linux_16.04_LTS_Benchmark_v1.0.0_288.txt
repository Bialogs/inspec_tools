6.2.20 Ensure shadow group is empty (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
The shadow group allows system programs which require access the ability to read the
/etc/shadow file. No users should be assigned to the shadow group.
Rationale:
Any users assigned to the shadow group would be granted read access to the /etc/shadow
file. If attackers can gain read access to the /etc/shadow file, they can easily run a
password cracking program against the hashed passwords to break them. Other security
information that is stored in the /etc/shadow file (such as expiration) could also be useful
to subvert additional user accounts.
Audit:
Run the following commands and verify no results are returned:
# grep ^shadow:[^:]*:[^:]*:[^:]+ /etc/group
# awk -F: '($4 == "<shadow-gid>") { print }' /etc/passwd

Remediation:
Remove all users from the shadow group, and change the primary group of any users with
shadow as their primary group.
