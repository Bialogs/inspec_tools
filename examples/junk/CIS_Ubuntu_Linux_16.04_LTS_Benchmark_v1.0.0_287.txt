6.2.19 Ensure no duplicate group names exist (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
Although the groupadd program will not let you create a duplicate group name, it is
possible for an administrator to manually edit the /etc/group file and change the group
name.
Rationale:
If a group is assigned a duplicate group name, it will create and have access to files with the
first GID for that group in /etc/group. Effectively, the GID is shared, which is a security
problem.
Audit:
Run the following script and verify no results are returned:
#!/bin/bash
cat /etc/group | cut -f1 -d":" | sort -n | uniq -c | while read x ; do
[ -z "${x}" ] && break
set - $x
if [ $1 -gt 1 ]; then
gids=`gawk -F: '($1 == n) { print $3 }' n=$2 /etc/group | xargs`
echo "Duplicate Group Name ($2): ${gids}"
fi
done

Remediation:
Based on the results of the audit script, establish unique names for the user groups. File
group ownerships will automatically reflect the change as long as the groups have unique
GIDs.
