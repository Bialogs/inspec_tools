Overview



                                                                                                    10 | P a g eThis document provides prescriptive guidance for establishing a secure configuration
posture for Ubuntu Linux 16.04 LTS systems running on x86 and x64 platforms.

Many lists are included including filesystem types, services, clients, and network
protocols. Not all items in these lists are guaranteed to exist on all distributions and

additional similar items may exist which should be considered in addition to those
explicitly mentioned.

The guidance within broadly assumes that operations are being performed as the root
user. Non-root users may not be able to access certain areas of the system, especially after

remediation has been performed. It is advisable to verify root users path integrity and the
integrity of any programs being run prior to execution of commands and scripts included in
this benchmark.

you have questions, comments, or have identified ways to improve this guide, please write
us at feedback@cisecurity.org.




Intended Audience

This benchmark is intended for system and application administrators, security specialists,

auditors, help desk, and platform deployment personnel who plan to develop, deploy,
assess, or secure solutions that incorporate Linux on a x86 platform.




Consensus Guidance

This benchmark was created using a consensus review process comprised of subject
matter experts. Consensus participants provide perspective from a diverse set of

backgrounds including consulting, software development, audit and compliance, security
research, operations, government, and legal.

Each CIS benchmark undergoes two phases of consensus review. The first phase occurs
during initial benchmark development. During this phase, subject matter experts convene

to discuss, create, and test working drafts of the benchmark. This discussion occurs until
consensus has been reached on benchmark recommendations. The second phase begins
after the benchmark has been published. During this phase, all feedback provided by the

Internet community is reviewed by the consensus team for incorporation in the



                                                                                11 | P a g ebenchmark. If you are interested in participating in the consensus process, please visit

1 Initial Setup

Items in this section are advised for all systems, but may be difficult or require extensive
preparation after the initial setup of the system.


1.1 Filesystem Configuration

Directories that are used for system-wide functions can be further protected by placing
them on separate partitions. This provides protection for resource exhaustion and enables
the use of mounting options that are applicable to the directory's intended use. Users' data

can be stored on separate partitions and have stricter mount options. A user partition is a
filesystem that has been established for use by the users and does not contain software for
system operations.

The recommendations in this section are easier to perform during initial system

installation. If the system is already installed, it is recommended that a full backup be
performed before repartitioning the system.



Note: If you are repartitioning a system that has already been installed, make sure the data
has been copied over to the new partition, unmount it and then remove the data from the
directory that was in the old partition. Otherwise it will still consume space in the old

partition that will be masked when the new filesystem is mounted. For example, if a system
is in single-user mode with no filesystems mounted and the administrator adds a lot of data
to the/tmp directory, this data will still consume spa/eonce the /tmpfilesystem is

mounted unless it is removed first.















                                                                            15 | P a g e1.1.1 Disable unused filesystems


A number of uncommon filesystem types are supported under Linux. Removing support
for unneeded filesystem types reduces the local attack surface of the system. If a filesystem
type is not needed it should be disabled. Native Linux file systems are designed to ensure

that built-in security controls function as expected. Non-native filesystems can lead to
unexpected consequences to both the security and functionality of the system and should
be used with caution. Many filesystems are created for niche use cases and are not

maintained and supported as the operating systems are updated and patched. Users of
non-native filesystems should ensure that there is attention and ongoing support for them,
especially in light of frequent operating system changes.


Standard network connectivity and Internet access to cloud storage may make the use of
non-standard filesystem formats to directly attach heterogeneous devices much less
attractive.



Note: This should not be considered a comprehensive list of filesystems. You may wish to

consider additions to those listed here for your environment.

Profile Applicability:


 Level 1 - Server

 Level 2 - Workstation


Description:

The FAT  filesystem format is primarily used on older windows systems and portable USB
drives or flash modules. It comes in three typesFAT12 ,FAT16 , andFAT32 all of which are

supported by the  vfat kernel module.

Rationale:


Removing support for unneeded filesystem types reduces the local attack surface of the
system. If this filesystem type is not needed, disable it.


Audit:

Run the following commands and verify the output is as indicated:

# modprobe -n -v vfat
install /bin/true
# lsmod | grep vfat
<No output>

Remediation:

Edit or create the fi/etc/modprobe.d/CIS.conf      and add the following line:


install vfat /bin/true

Impact:

FAT filesystems are often used on portable USB sticks and other flash media are commonly

used to transfer files between workstations, removing VFAT support may prevent the
ability to transfer files in this way.










                                                                                24 | P a g e1.1.2 Ensure separate partition exists for /tmp (Scored)

Profile Applicability:


 Level 2 - Server

 Level 2 - Workstation

Description:


The /tmp  directory is a world-writable directory used for temporary storage by all users
and some applications.


Rationale:

Since the /tmp directory is intended to be world-writable, there is a risk of resource
exhaustion if it is not bound to a separate partition. In addition, mak/tmp  its own file

system allows an administrator to set the noexec  option on the mount, making  /tmp
useless for an attacker to install executable code. It would also prevent an attacker from

establishing a hardlink to a systemsetuid  program and wait for it to be updated. Once the
program was updated, the hardlink would be broken and the attacker would have his own
copy of the program. If the program happened to have a security vulnerability, the attacker

could continue to exploit the known flaw.

Audit:


Run the following command and verify output shows    /tmp is mounted:

# mount | grep /tmp
tmpfs on /tmp type tmpfs (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime)

Remediation:

For new installations, during installation create a custom partition setup and specify a

separate partition for/tmp .

For systems that were previously installed, create a new partition and configure
/etc/fstab  as appropriate.


Impact:

Resizing filesystems is a common activity in cloud-hosted servers. Separate filesystem

partitions may prevent successful resizing, or may require the installation of additional
tools solely for the purpose of resizing operations. The use of these additional tools may
introduce their own security considerations.

                                                                                25 | P a g eReferences:

Profile Applicability:

 Level 1 - Server

 Level 1 - Workstation


Description:

The nodev  mount option specifies that the filesystem cannot contain special devices.


Rationale:

Since the /tmp filesystem is not intended to support devices, set this option to ensure that

users cannot attempt to create block or character special devices i/tmp .

Audit:


If a/tmp partition exists run the following command and verify that thenodev  option is set
on /tmp:

# mount | grep /tmp
tmpfs on /tmp type tmpfs (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime)


Remediation:

Edit the/etc/fstab   file and addnodev  to the fourth field (mounting options) for
the /tmp partition. See thfstab(5)   manual page for more information.


Run the following command to remount    /tmp :

# mount -o remount,nodev /tmp

Notes:


systemd includes the tmp.mount  service which should be used instead of
configuring /etc/fstab  . Mounting options are configured in the Options setting

in/etc/systemd/system/tmp.mount     .

Profile Applicability:

 Level 1 - Server


 Level 1 - Workstation

Description:


The nosuid   mount option specifies that the filesystem cannot contain setuid files.

Rationale:


Since the /tmp  filesystem is only intended for temporary file storage, set this option to
ensure that users cannot create setuid  files i/tmp .


Audit:

If a/tmp partition exists run the following command and verify that the nosuid option is set
on /tmp:


# mount | grep /tmp
tmpfs on /tmp type tmpfs (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime)

Remediation:

Edit the/etc/fstab   file and addnosuid  to the fourth field (mounting options) for

the /tmp partition. See thefstab(5)  manual page for more information.

Run the following command to remount     /tmp:


# mount -o remount,nosuid /tmp

Notes:

systemd includes the  tmp.mount  service which should be used instead of

configuring /etc/fstab  . Mounting options are configured in the Options  setting
in/etc/systemd/system/tmp.mount      .

Profile Applicability:

 Level 2 - Server


 Level 2 - Workstation

Description:

The /var directory is used by daemons and other system services to temporarily store

dynamic data. Some directories created by these processes may be world-writable.

Rationale:

Since the /var directory may contain world-writable files and directories, there is a risk of

resource exhaustion if it is not bound to a separate partition.

Audit:


Run the following command and verify output shows    /var is mounted:

# mount | grep /var
/dev/xvdg1 on /var type ext4 (rw,relatime,data=ordered)

Remediation:

For new installations, during installation create a custom partition setup and specify a

separate partition for/var .

For systems that were previously installed, create a new partition and
configure /etc/fstab  as appropriate.


Impact:

Resizing filesystems is a common activity in cloud-hosted servers. Separate filesystem
partitions may prevent successful resizing, or may require the installation of additional

tools solely for the purpose of resizing operations. The use of these additional tools may
introduce their own security considerations.

Profile Applicability:


 Level 2 - Server

 Level 2 - Workstation

Description:


The /var/tmp   directory is a world-writable directory used for temporary storage by all
users and some applications.


Rationale:

Since the /var/tmp  directory is intended to be world-writable, there is a risk of resource
exhaustion if it is not bound to a separate partition. In addition, maki/var/tmp  its own

file system allows an administrator to set thnoexec  option on the mount,
making  /var/tmp  useless for an attacker to install executable code. It would also prevent

an attacker from establishing a hardlink to a systemsetuid  program and wait for it to be
updated. Once the program was updated, the hardlink would be broken and the attacker
would have his own copy of the program. If the program happened to have a security

vulnerability, the attacker could continue to exploit the known flaw.

Audit:


Run the following command and verify output shows    /var/tmp  is mounted:

# mount | grep /var/tmp
tmpfs on /var/tmp type ext4 (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime)

Remediation:

For new installations, during installation create a custom partition setup and specify a

separate partition for/var/tmp .

For systems that were previously installed, create a new partition and
configure /etc/fstab  as appropriate.


Impact:

Resizing filesystems is a common activity in cloud-hosted servers. Separate filesystem

partitions may prevent successful resizing, or may require the installation of additional
tools solely for the purpose of resizing operations. The use of these additional tools may
introduce their own security considerations.

                                                                                30 | P a g e1.1.7 Ensure nodev option set on /var/tmp partition (Scored)


Profile Applicability:

 Level 1 - Server

 Level 1 - Workstation


Description:

The nodev   mount option specifies that the filesystem cannot contain special devices.


Rationale:

Since the /var/tmp  filesystem is not intended to support devices, set this option to ensure

that users cannot attempt to create block or character special devices in/var/tmp  .

Audit:


If a/var/tmp  partition exists run the following command and verify that the nodev  option is
set on /var/tmp .

# mount | grep /var/tmp
tmpfs on /var/tmp type tmpfs (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime)


Remediation:

Edit the/etc/fstab    file and addnodev  to the fourth field (mounting options) for
the /var/tmp  partition. See thefstab(5)  manual page for more information.


Run the following command to remount     /var/tmp :

# mount -o remount,nodev /var/tmp


















                                                                                 31 | P a g e1.1.8 Ensure nosuid option set on /var/tmp partition (Scored)

Profile Applicability:


 Level 1 - Server

 Level 1 - Workstation


Description:

The nosuid   mount option specifies that the filesystem cannot contain setuid  files.


Rationale:

Since the /var/tmp  filesystem is only intended for temporary file storage, set this option to

ensure that users cannot create setuid  files i/var/tmp  .

Audit:

If a/var/tmp  partition exists run the following command and verify that the nosuid  option

is set on/var/tmp .

# mount | grep /var/tmp
tmpfs on /var/tmp type tmpfs (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime)

Remediation:


Edit the/etc/fstab   file and addnosuid  to the fourth field (mounting options) for
the /var/tmp  partition. See thefstab(5)  manual page for more information.


Run the following command to remount     /var/tmp :

# mount -o remount,nosuid /var/tmp

















                                                                                 32 | P a g e1.1.9 Ensure noexec option set on /var/tmp partition (Scored)

Profile Applicability:


 Level 1 - Server

 Level 1 - Workstation


Description:

The noexec   mount option specifies that the filesystem cannot contain executable binaries.


Rationale:

Since the /var/tmp  filesystem is only intended for temporary file storage, set this option to

ensure that users cannot run executable binaries from  /var/tmp  .

Audit:

If a/var/tmp  partition exists run the following command and verify that the noexec  option

is set on/var/tmp .

# mount | grep /var/tmp
tmpfs on /var/tmp type tmpfs (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime)

Remediation:


Edit the/etc/fstab    file and addnoexec  to the fourth field (mounting options) for the
/var/tmp  partition. See thefstab(5)  manual page for more information.


Run the following command to remount     /var/tmp :

# mount -o remount,noexec /var/tmp

















                                                                                 33 | P a g e1.1.10 Ensure separate partition exists for /var/log (Scored)


Profile Applicability:

 Level 2 - Server


 Level 2 - Workstation

Description:

The /var/log  directory is used by system services to store log data .


Rationale:

There are two important reasons to ensure that system logs are stored on a separate
partition: protection against resource exhaustion (since logs can grow quite large) and

protection of audit data.

Audit:

Run the following command and verify output shows    /var/log  is mounted:

# mount | grep /var/log
/dev/xvdh1 on /var/log type ext4 (rw,relatime,data=ordered)


Remediation:

For new installations, during installation create a custom partition setup and specify a
separate partition for/var/log .


For systems that were previously installed, create a new partition and
configure /etc/fstab  as appropriate.

Impact:


Resizing filesystems is a common activity in cloud-hosted servers. Separate filesystem
partitions may prevent successful resizing, or may require the installation of additional
tools solely for the purpose of resizing operations. The use of these additional tools may

introduce their own security considerations.

Profile Applicability:


 Level 2 - Server

 Level 2 - Workstation

Description:


The auditing daemon,  auditd , stores log data in t/var/log/audit    directory.

Rationale:

There are two important reasons to ensure that data gathered by  auditd  is stored on a

separate partition: protection against resource exhaustion (since theaudit.log  file can
grow quite large) and protection of audit data. The audit daemon calculates how much free

space is left and performs actions based on the results. If other processes (such syslog )
consume space in the same partition as  auditd , it may not perform as desired.


Audit:

Run the following command and verify output shows    /var/log/audit   is mounted:

# mount | grep /var/log/audit
/dev/xvdi1 on /var/log/audit type ext4 (rw,relatime,data=ordered)

Remediation:


For new installations, during installation create a custom partition setup and specify a
separate partition for/var/log/audit  .

For systems that were previously installed, create a new partition and

configure /etc/fstab  as appropriate.

Profile Applicability:


 Level 2 - Server

 Level 2 - Workstation

Description:


The /home  directory is used to support disk storage needs of local users.

Rationale:

If the system is intended to support local users, create a separate partition for /home

directory to protect against resource exhaustion and restrict the type of files that can be
stored under  /home.


Audit:

Run the following command and verify output shows     /home is mounted:

# mount | grep /home
/dev/xvdf1 on /home type ext4 (rw,nodev,relatime,data=ordered)

Remediation:


For new installations, during installation create a custom partition setup and specify a
separate partition for/home .

For systems that were previously installed, create a new partition and

configure /etc/fstab  as appropriate.

Impact:

Profile Applicability:


 Level 1 - Server

 Level 1 - Workstation


Description:

The nodev  mount option specifies that the filesystem cannot contain special devices.

Rationale:


Since the user partitions are not intended to support devices, set this option to ensure that
users cannot attempt to create block or character special devices.


Audit:

If a/home partition exists run the following command and verify that thenodev  option is set
on /home .


# mount | grep /home
/dev/xvdf1 on /home type ext4 (rw,nodev,relatime,data=ordered)

Remediation:

Edit the/etc/fstab   file and addnodev  to the fourth field (mounting options) for the

/home partition. See thefstab(5)  manual page for more information.

# mount -o remount,nodev /home

Notes:


The actions in this recommendation refer to the /home  partition, which is the default user
partition that is defined in many distributions. If you have created other user partitions, it
is recommended that the Remediation and Audit steps be applied to these partitions as

well.

Profile Applicability:

 Level 1 - Server

 Level 1 - Workstation


Description:

The nodev  mount option specifies that the filesystem cannot contain special devices.


Rationale:

Since the /run/shm  filesystem is not intended to support devices, set this option to ensure

that users cannot attempt to create special devices i/dev/shm   partitions.

Audit:


Run the following command and verify that the  nodev  option is set o/dev/shm  .

# mount | grep /dev/shm
tmpfs on /dev/shm type tmpfs (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime)

Remediation:

Edit the/etc/fstab   file and addnodev  to the fourth field (mounting options) for

the /dev/shm  partition. See thfstab(5)   manual page for more information.

Run the following command to remount    /dev/shm  :

# mount -o remount,nodev /dev/shm




















                                                                                38 | P a g e1.1.15 Ensure nosuid option set on /dev/shm partition (Scored)

Profile Applicability:


 Level 1 - Server

 Level 1 - Workstation


Description:

The nosuid  mount option specifies that the filesystem cannot contain setuid files.


Rationale:

Profile Applicability:


 Level 1 - Server

 Level 1 - Workstation


Description:

The noexec  mount option specifies that the filesystem cannot contain executable binaries.


Rationale:

Setting this option on a file system prevents users from executing programs from shared
memory. This deters users from introducing potentially malicious software on the system.


Audit:

Run the following command and verify that the  noexec  option is set on/run/shm .


tmpfs on /dev/shm type tmpfs (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime)

the /dev/shm  partition. See thfstab(5)   manual page for more information.

Run the following command to remount    /dev/shm  :

# mount -o remount,noexec /dev/shm



















                                                                                40 | P a g e1.1.17 Ensure nodev option set on removable media partitions (Not

Scored)


Profile Applicability:

 Level 1 - Server


 Level 1 - Workstation

Description:

The nodev  mount option specifies that the filesystem cannot contain special devices.


Rationale:

Removable media containing character and block special devices could be used to
circumvent security controls by allowing non-root users to access sensitive device files

such as /dev/kmem  or the raw disk partitions.

Audit:

Run the following command and verify that the nodev option is set on all removable media

partitions.

# mount

Remediation:

Edit the/etc/fstab   file and adnodev  to the fourth field (mounting options) of all

Profile Applicability:


 Level 1 - Server

 Level 1 - Workstation

Description:


Setting the sticky bit on world writable directories prevents users from deleting or
renaming files in that directory that are not owned by them.


Rationale:

This feature prevents the ability to delete or rename files in world writable directories
(such as /tmp) that are owned by another user.


Audit:

Run the following command to verify no world writable directories exist without the sticky
bit set:

# df --local -P | awk {'if (NR!=1) print $6'} | xargs -I '{}' find '{}' -xdev -type d
\( -perm -0002 -a ! -perm -1000 \) 2>/dev/null

No output should be returned.

Remediation:

Run the following command to set the sticky bit on all world writable directories:


-perm -0002 2>/dev/null | chmod a+tprint $6'} | xargs -I '{}' find '{}' -xdev -type d


















                                                                                44 | P a g e1.1.21 Disable Automounting (Scored)


Profile Applicability:

 Level 1 - Server


 Level 2 - Workstation

Description:

autofs  allows automatic mounting of devices, typically including CD/DVDs and USB drives.


Rationale:

With automounting enabled anyone with physical access could attach a USB drive or disc
and have its contents available in system even if they lacked permissions to mount it

themselves.

Audit:

Run the following command to verify  autofs   is not enabled:

# systemctl is-enabled autofs
disabled

Verify result is not "enabled".

Remediation:

Run the following command to disable   autofs :

# systemctl disable autofs


Impact:

The use portable hard drives is very common for workstation users. If your organization
allows the use of portable storage or media on workstations and physical access controls to

workstations is considered adequate there is little value add in turning off automounting.

Notes:

This control should align with the tolerance of the use of portable drives and optical media

in the organization. On a server requiring an admin to manually mount media can be part
of defense-in-depth to reduce the risk of unapproved software or information being

introduced or proprietary software or information being exfiltrated. If admins commonly


                                                                                45 | P a g euse flash drives and Server access has sufficient physical controls, requiring manual
mounting may not increase security.





















































                                                                                      46 | P a g e1.2 Configure Software Updates


Ubuntu Linux uses apt to install and update software packages. Patch management
procedures may vary widely between enterprises. Large enterprises may choose to install a
local updates server that can be used in place of Ubuntu's servers, whereas a single
deployment of a system may prefer to get updates directly. Updates can be performed

automatically or manually, depending on the site's policy for patch management. Many
large enterprises prefer to test patches on a non-production system before rolling out to
production.


For the purpose of this benchmark, the requirement is to ensure that a patch management
system is configured and maintained. The specifics on patch update procedures are left to
the organization.


1.2.1 Ensure package manager repositories are configured (Not Scored)

Profile Applicability:

 Level 1 - Server

 Level 1 - Workstation


Description:

Systems need to have package manager repositories configured to ensure they receive the
latest patches and updates.

Rationale:

If a system's package repositories are misconfigured important patches may not be

identified or a rogue repository could introduce compromised software.

Audit:

Run the following command and verify package repositories are configured correctly:

# apt-cache policy

Remediation:

Configure your package manager repositories according to site policy.






                                                                               47 | P a g e1.2.2 Ensure GPG keys are configured (Not Scored)


Profile Applicability:

 Level 1 - Server

 Level 1 - Workstation


Description:

Most packages managers implement GPG key signing to verify package integrity during
installation.


Rationale:

It is important to ensure that updates are obtained from a valid source to protect against
spoofing that could lead to the inadvertent installation of malware on the system.

Audit:


Run the following command and verify GPG keys are configured correctly for your package
manager:

# apt-key list

Remediation:

Update your package manager GPG keys in accordance with site policy.























                                                                               48 | P a g e1.3 Filesystem Integrity Checking


AIDE is a file integrity checking tool, similar in nature to Tripwire. While it cannot prevent
intrusions, it can detect unauthorized changes to configuration files by alerting when the

files are changed. When setting up AIDE, decide internally what the site policy will be
concerning integrity checking. Review the AIDE quick start guide and AIDE documentation
before proceeding.


1.3.1 Ensure AIDE is installed (Scored)

Profile Applicability:


 Level 1 - Server

 Level 1 - Workstation

Description:

AIDE takes a snapshot of filesystem state including modification times, permissions, and

file hashes which can then be used to compare against the current state of the filesystem to
detect modifications to the system.

Rationale:


By monitoring the filesystem state compromised files can be detected to prevent or limit
the exposure of accidental or malicious misconfigurations or modified binaries.

Audit:

Run the following command and verify AIDE is installed:

# dpkg -s aide


Remediation:

Run the following command to install AIDE:

# apt-get install aide
Configure AIDE as appropriate for your environment. Consult the AIDE documentation for

options.

Initialize AIDE:

# aide --init



                                                                                49 | P a g eReferences:

    1. AIDE stable manual: http://aide.sourceforge.net/stable/manual.html


Notes:

The prelinking feature can interfere with AIDE because it alters binaries to speed up their
start up times. Run prelink -ua   to restore the binaries to their prelinked state, thus

avoiding false positives from AIDE.













































                                                                                50 | P a g e1.3.2 Ensure filesystem integrity is regularly checked (Scored)


Profile Applicability:

 Level 1 - Server


 Level 1 - Workstation

Description:

Periodic checking of the filesystem integrity is needed to detect changes to the filesystem.


Rationale:

Periodic file checking allows the system administrator to determine on a regular basis if
critical files have been changed in an unauthorized fashion.


Audit:

Run the following commands to determine if there is a  cron job scheduled to run the aide

check.

# grep -r aide /etc/cron.* /etc/crontab

Ensure a cron job in compliance with site policy is returned.

Remediation:

Run the following command:

# crontab -u root -e

Add the following line to the crontab:

0 5 * * * /usr/bin/aide --check

Notes:

The checking in this recommendation occurs every day at 5am. Alter the frequency and

time of the checks in compliance with site policy.










                                                                                51 | P a g e1.4 Secure Boot Settings


The recommendations in this section focus on securing the bootloader and settings
involved in the boot process directly.


1.4.1 Ensure permissions on bootloader config are configured (Scored)


Profile Applicability:

 Level 1 - Server

 Level 1 - Workstation


Description:

The grub configuration file contains information on boot settings and passwords for

unlocking boot options. The grub configuration is usuallgrub.cfg  stored in/boot/grub.

Rationale:


Setting the permissions to read and write for root only prevents non-root users from
seeing the boot parameters or changing them. Non-root users who read the boot
parameters may be able to identify weaknesses in security upon boot and be able to exploit

them.

Audit:


Run the following command and verify  Uid and Gid are both 0/root and Access  does not
grant permissions to group orother :

# stat /boot/grub/grub.cfg
Access: (0600/-rw-------)   Uid: (    0/    root)   Gid: (    0/     root)


Remediation:

Run the following commands to set permissions on your grub configuration:

# chown root:root /boot/grub/grub.cfg
# chmod og-rwx /boot/grub/grub.cfg


Notes:

This recommendation is designed around the grub bootloader, if LILO or another
bootloader is in use in your environment enact equivalent settings.




                                                                              52 | P a g e1.4.2 Ensure bootloader password is set (Scored)


Profile Applicability:

 Level 1 - Server


 Level 1 - Workstation

Description:


Setting the boot loader password will require that anyone rebooting the system must enter
a password before being able to set command line boot parameters


Rationale:

Requiring a boot password upon execution of the boot loader will prevent an unauthorized

user from entering boot parameters or changing the boot partition. This prevents users
from weakening security (e.g. turning off SELinux at boot time).


Audit:

Run the following commands and verify output matches:


set superusers="<username>"oot/grub/grub.cfg
# grep "^password" /boot/grub/grub.cfg
password_pbkdf2 <username> <encrypted-password>


Remediation:

Create an encrypted password with   grub-mkpasswd-pbkdf2   :

# grub-mkpasswd-pbkdf2
Enter password: <password>
Reenter password: <password>
Your PBKDF2 is <encrypted-password>

Add the following into/etc/grub.d/00_header    or a custom /etc/grub.d   configuration file:

cat <<EOF
set superusers="<username>"
password_pbkdf2 <username> <encrypted-password>
EOF
Run the following command to update the   grub2 configuration:

# update-grub

Profile Applicability:

 Level 1 - Server


 Level 1 - Workstation

Description:

Single user mode is used for recovery when the system detects an issue during boot or by

manual selection from the bootloader.

Rationale:

Requiring authentication in single user mode prevents an unauthorized user from

rebooting the system into single user to gain root privileges without credentials.

Audit:


Perform the following to determine if a password is set for throot  user:

# grep ^root:[*\!]: /etc/shadow
No results should be returned.

Remediation:


Run the following command and follow the prompts to set a password for the   root  user:

# passwd root




















                                                                               55 | P a g e1.5 Additional Process Hardening




1.5.1 Ensure core dumps are restricted (Scored)

Profile Applicability:


 Level 1 - Server

 Level 1 - Workstation


Description:

A core dump is the memory of an executable program. It is generally used to determine
why a program aborted. It can also be used to glean confidential information from a core

file. The system provides the ability to set a soft limit for core dumps, but this can be
overridden by the user.


Rationale:

Setting a hard limit on core dumps prevents users from overriding the soft variable. If core
dumps are required, consider setting limits for user groups (seelimits.conf(5)   ). In

addition, setting thefs.suid_dumpable   variable to 0 will prevent setuid programs from
dumping core.


Audit:

Run the following commands and verify output matches:

# grep "hard core" /etc/security/limits.conf /etc/security/limits.d/*
* hard core 0
# sysctl fs.suid_dumpable
fs.suid_dumpable = 0

Remediation:

Add the following line to the/etc/security/limits.conf      file or a

/etc/security/limits.d/*     file:

* hard core 0
Set the following parameter in the /etc/sysctl.conf    file:

fs.suid_dumpable = 0

Run the following command to set the active kernel parameter:

                                                                                56 | P a g e# sysctl -w fs.suid_dumpable=0





























































                                                                                     57 | P a g e1.5.2 Ensure XD/NX support is enabled (Not Scored)


Profile Applicability:

 Level 1 - Server

 Level 1 - Workstation


Description:

Recent processors in the x86 family support the ability to prevent code execution on a per
memory page basis. Generically and on AMD processors, this ability is called No Execute

(NX), while on Intel processors it is called Execute Disable (XD). This ability can help
prevent exploitation of buffer overflow vulnerabilities and should be activated whenever
possible. Extra steps must be taken to ensure that this protection is enabled, particularly on

32-bit x86 systems. Other processors, such as Itanium and POWER, have included such
support since inception and the standard kernel for those platforms supports the feature.

Rationale:

Enabling any feature that can protect against buffer overflow attacks enhances the security

of the system.



Audit:

Run the following command and verify your kernel has identified and activated NX/XD

protection.

# dmesg | grep NX
NX (Execute Disable) protection: active


Remediation:

On 32 bit systems install a kernel with PAE support, no installation is required on 64 bit

systems:

If necessary configure your bootloader to load the new kernel and reboot the system.

You may need to enable NX or XD support in your bios.


Notes:



                                                                                58 | P a g eEnsure your system supports the XD or NX bit and has PAE support before implementing
this recommendation as this may prevent it from booting if these are not supported by

your hardware.



















































                                                                                  59 | P a g e1.5.3 Ensure address space layout randomization (ASLR) is enabled

(Scored)


Profile Applicability:

 Level 1 - Server


 Level 1 - Workstation

Description:

Address space layout randomization (ASLR) is an exploit mitigation technique which

randomly arranges the address space of key data areas of a process.

Rationale:

Randomly placing virtual memory regions will make it difficult to write memory page

exploits as the memory placement will be consistently shifting.

Audit:

Run the following command and verify output matches:

# sysctl kernel.randomize_va_space
kernel.randomize_va_space = 2


Remediation:

Set the following parameter in the/etc/sysctl.conf    file:

kernel.randomize_va_space = 2
Run the following command to set the active kernel parameter:

# sysctl -w kernel.randomize_va_space=2
















                                                                               60 | P a g e1.5.4 Ensure prelink is disabled (Scored)


Profile Applicability:

 Level 1 - Server

 Level 1 - Workstation


Description:

prelink  is a program that modifies ELF shared libraries and ELF dynamically linked
binaries in such a way that the time needed for the dynamic linker to perform relocations

at startup significantly decreases.

Rationale:

The prelinking feature can interfere with the operation of AIDE, because it changes

binaries. Prelinking can also increase the vulnerability of the system if a malicious user is
able to compromise a common library such as libc.

Audit:


Run the following command and verify   prelink  is not installed:

# dpkg -s prelink

Remediation:

Run the following command to restore binaries to normal:

# prelink -ua

Run the following command to uninstall  prelink  :

# apt-get remove prelink

1.6 Mandatory Access Control


Mandatory Access Control (MAC) provides an additional layer of access restrictions to
processes on top of the base Discretionary Access Controls. By restricting how processes
can access files and resources on a system the potential impact from vulnerabilities in the

processes can be reduced.






                                                                                61 | P a g eImpact: Mandatory Access Control limits the capabilities of applications and daemons on a
system, while this can prevent unauthorized access the configuration of MAC can be

complex and difficult to implement correctly preventing legitimate access from occurring.



Note: Apparmor is the default MAC provided with Ubuntu systems.















































                                                                                    62 | P a g e1.6.1 Configure SELinux

SELinux provides a Mandatory Access Control (MAC) system that greatly augments the

default Discretionary Access Control (DAC) model. Under SELinux, every process and every
object (files, sockets, pipes) on the system is assigned a security context, a label that

includes detailed type information about the object. The kernel allows processes to access
objects only if that access is explicitly allowed by the policy in effect. The policy defines
transitions, so that a user can be allowed to run software, but the software can run under a

different context than the user's default. This automatically limits the damage that the
software can do to files accessible by the calling user. The user does not need to take any

action to gain this benefit. For an action to occur, both the traditional DAC permissions
must be satisfied as well as the SELinux MAC rules. The action will not be allowed if either
one of these models does not permit the action. In this way, SELinux rules can only make a

system's permissions more restrictive and secure. SELinux requires a complex policy to
allow all the actions required of a system under normal operation. Three such policies have

been available for use with Ubuntu and are included with the system:    ubuntu ,default ,
strict , and mls. These are described as follows:


      ubuntu : targeted rules developed for ubuntu specifically
      default  : targeted rules developed and maintained by Debian. Consists mostly of
       Type Enforcement (TE) rules, and a small number of Role-Based Access Control

       (RBAC) rules. Targeted restricts the actions of many types of programs, but leaves
       interactive users largely unaffected.
      strict : also uses TE and RBAC rules, but on more programs and more aggressively.
      mls : implements Multi-Level Security (MLS), which introduces even more kinds of
       labels (sensitivity and category) and rules that govern access based on these.


This section provides guidance for the configuration of the  targeted  policy.

Note: This section only applies if SELinux is in use on the system. Recommendations for

AppArmor are also included, and additional Mandatory Access Control systems exist
beyond these two. AppArmor is the standard MAC system for Ubuntu systems.

Description:

Configure SELinux to meet or exceed the default targeted policy, which constrains daemons

Rationale:

Security configuration requirements vary from site to site. Some sites may mandate a
policy that is stricter than the default policy, which is perfectly acceptable. This item is

intended to ensure that at least the default recommendations are met.

Profile Applicability:

 Level 2 - Server


 Level 2 - Workstation

Description:

Daemons that are not defined in SELinux policy will inherit the security context of their
parent process.


Rationale:

Since daemons are launched and descend from the   init  process, they will inherit the
security context labelinitrc_t . This could cause the unintended consequence of giving the

process more permission than it requires.

Audit:

Run the following command and verify not output is produced:

# ps -eZ | egrep "initrc" | egrep -vw "tr|ps|egrep|bash|awk" | tr ':' ' ' | awk '{
print $NF }'


Remediation:

Investigate any unconfined daemons found during the audit action. They may need to have
an existing security context assigned to them or a policy built for them.


Notes:

Occasionally certain daemons such as backup or centralized management software may
require running unconfined. Any such software should be carefully analyzed and

documented before such an exception is made.













                                                                               68 | P a g e1.6.2 Configure AppArmor

AppArmor provides a Mandatory Access Control (MAC) system that greatly augments the

default Discretionary Access Control (DAC) model. Under AppArmor MAC rules are applied
by file paths instead of by security contexts as in other MAC systems. As such it does not
require support in the filesystem and can be applied to network mounted filesystems for

example. AppArmor security policies define what system resources applications can access
and what privileges they can do so with. This automatically limits the damage that the
software can do to files accessible by the calling user. The user does not need to take any
action to gain this benefit. For an action to occur, both the traditional DAC permissions

must be satisfied as well as the AppArmor MAC rules. The action will not be allowed if
either one of these models does not permit the action. In this way, AppArmor rules can only
make a system's permissions more restrictive and secure.

Note: This section only applies if AppArmor is in use on the system. Recommendations for

SELinux are also included, and additional Mandatory Access Control systems exist beyond
these two.

1.7 Warning Banners

Presenting a warning message prior to the normal user login may assist in the prosecution

of trespassers on the computer system. Changing some of these login banners also has the
side effect of hiding OS version information and other detailed system information from
attackers attempting to target specific exploits at a system.


Guidelines published by the US Department of Defense require that warning messages
include at least the name of the organization that owns the system, the fact that the system
is subject to monitoring and that such monitoring is in compliance with local statutes, and

that use of the system implies consent to such monitoring. It is important that the
organization's legal counsel review the content of all messages before any system
modifications are made, as these warning messages are inherently site-specific. More

 Level 1 - Workstation

Description:


The contents of the/etc/issue.net   file are displayed to users prior to login for remote
connections from configured services.

Unix-based systems have typically displayed information about the OS release and patch

level upon logging in to the system. This information can be useful to developers who are
developing software for a particular OS platform. Imingetty(8)   supports the following
options, they display operating system information:


\m - machine architecture

\r - operating system release
\s - operating system name

\v - operating system version

Rationale:

Warning messages inform users who are attempting to login to the system of their legal

status regarding the system and must include the name of the organization that owns the
system and any monitoring policies that are in place. Displaying OS and patch level

information in login banners also has the side effect of providing detailed system
information to attackers attempting to target specific exploits of a system. Authorized users
can easily get this information by running theuname -a " command once they have logged

in.

Site policy may mandate a testing period before install onto production systems for
available updates.


2 Services

While applying system updates and patches helps correct known vulnerabilities, one of the

best ways to protect the system against as yet unreported vulnerabilities is to disable all
services that are not required for normal system operation. This prevents the exploitation
of vulnerabilities discovered at a later date. If a service is not enabled, it cannot be

exploited. The actions in this section of the document provide guidance on some services

                                                                                86 | P a g ewhich can be safely disabled and under which circumstances, greatly reducing the number
of possible threats to the resulting system. Additionally some services which should

It is recommended that physical systems and virtual guests lacking direct access to the
physical host's clock be configured to synchronize their time using a service such as NTP or

chrony.

2.2.1.1 Ensure time synchronization is in use (Not Scored)


Profile Applicability:

 Level 1 - Server

 Level 1 - Workstation

Description:


System time should be synchronized between all systems in an environment. This is
typically done by establishing an authoritative time server or set of servers and having all
systems synchronize their clocks to them.


Rationale:

Time synchronization is important to support time sensitive security mechanisms like
Kerberos and also ensures log files have consistent time records across the enterprise,

which aids in forensic investigations.

Audit:

On physical systems or virtual systems where host based time synchronization is not
available run the following commands and verify either NTP or chrony is installed:

# dpkg -s ntp
# dpkg -s chrony

On virtual systems where host based time synchronization is available consult your
virtualization software documentation and verify that host based synchronization is in use.

Remediation:

On physical systems or virtual systems where host based time synchronization is not

available install NTP or chrony using one of the following commands:

# apt-get install ntp
# apt-get install chrony
On virtual systems where host based time synchronization is available consult your
virtualization software documentation and setup host based synchronization.

configured to be a client and/or a server.



This recommendation only applies if ntp is in use on the system.


Rationale:

If ntp is in use on the system proper configuration is vital to ensuring time synchronization

is working properly.

Profile Applicability:

 Level 1 - Server


 Level 1 - Workstation

Description:

Avahi is a free zeroconf implementation, including a system for multicast DNS/DNS-SD

service discovery. Avahi allows programs to publish and discover services and hosts
running on a local network with no specific configuration. For example, a user can plug a
computer into a network and Avahi automatically finds printers to print to, files to look at

and people to talk to, as well as network services running on the machine.

Rationale:

Automatic discovery of network services is not normally required for system

functionality. It is recommended to disable the service to reduce the potential attach
surface.

Description:

The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) server is used to listen for SNMP

commands from an SNMP management system, execute the commands or collect the
information and then send results back to the requesting system.

Rationale:


The SNMP server communicates using SNMP v1, which transmits data in the clear and does
not require authentication to execute commands. Unless absolutely necessary, it is
recommended that the SNMP service not be used.

(Scored)


Profile Applicability:

 Level 1 - Server


 Level 1 - Workstation

Description:

Mail Transfer Agents (MTA), such as sendmail and Postfix, are used to listen for incoming

mail and transfer the messages to the appropriate user or mail server. If the system is not
intended to be a mail server, it is recommended that the MTA be configured to only process
local mail.


Rationale:

The software for all Mail Transfer Agents is complex and most have a long history of
security issues. While it is important to ensure that the system can process local mail

messages, it is not necessary to have the MTA's daemon listening on a port unless the
server is intended to be a mail server that receives and processes mail from other systems.


Audit:

Run the following command and verify that the MTA is not listening on any non-loopback
address (127.0.0.1  or ::1):

# netstat -an | grep LIST | grep ":25[[:space:]]"
tcp 0 0 127.0.0.1:25 0.0.0.0:* LISTEN


Remediation:

Edit /etc/postfix/main.cf    and add the following line to the RECEIVING MAIL section. If
the line already exists, change it to look like the line below:

inet_interfaces = localhost

Restart postfix:

# service postfix restart

Notes:




                                                                              115 | P a g eThis recommendation is designed around the postfix mail server, depending on your

A number of insecure services exist. While disabling the servers prevents a local attack
against these services, it is advised to remove their clients unless they are required.



Note: This should not be considered a comprehensive list of insecure service clients. You

may wish to consider additions to those listed here for your environment.

2.3.1 Ensure NIS Client is not installed (Scored)


Profile Applicability:

 Level 1 - Server

 Level 1 - Workstation


Description:

The Network Information Service (NIS), formerly known as Yellow Pages, is a client-server
directory service protocol used to distribute system configuration files. The NIS client

(ypbind ) was used to bind a machine to an NIS server and receive the distributed
configuration files.

Rationale:

The NIS service is inherently an insecure system that has been vulnerable to DOS attacks,

buffer overflows and has poor authentication for querying NIS maps. NIS generally has
been replaced by such protocols as Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP). It is
recommended that the service be removed.


Audit:

Profile Applicability:


 Level 1 - Server

 Level 1 - Workstation


Description:

The rsh  package contains the client commands for the rsh services.

Rationale:


These legacy clients contain numerous security exposures and have been replaced with the
more secure SSH package. Even if the server is removed, it is best to ensure the clients are

also removed to prevent users from inadvertently attempting to use these commands and
therefore exposing their credentials. Note that removing the rsh  package removes the

clients forrsh,rcp  and rlogin .

Audit:

Run the following commands and verify    rsh is not installed:


dpkg -s rsh-redone-client


Remediation:

Run the following command to uninstall   rsh :

apt-get remove rsh-client rsh-redone-client


Impact:

3 Network Configuration

This section provides guidance on for securing the network configuration of the system

through kernel parameters, access list control, and firewall settings.








                                                                            124 | P a g e3.1 Network Parameters (Host Only)

The following network parameters are intended for use if the system is to act as a host

only. A system is considered host only if the system has a single interface, or has multiple
interfaces but will not be configured as a router.


3.1.1 Ensure IP forwarding is disabled (Scored)

Profile Applicability:

 Level 1 - Server


 Level 1 - Workstation

Description:

The net.ipv4.ip_forward    flag is used to tell the system whether it can forward packets or

not.

Rationale:


Setting the flag to 0 ensures that a system with multiple interfaces (for example, a hard
proxy), will never be able to forward packets, and therefore, never serve as a router.

Audit:


Run the following command and verify output matches:

# sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward
net.ipv4.ip_forward = 0

Remediation:

Set the following parameter in the/etc/sysctl.conf    file:

net.ipv4.ip_forward = 0

Run the following commands to set the active kernel parameters:

# sysctl -w net.ipv4.route.flush=1









                                                                              125 | P a g e3.1.2 Ensure packet redirect sending is disabled (Scored)

Profile Applicability:


 Level 1 - Server

 Level 1 - Workstation


Description:

ICMP Redirects are used to send routing information to other hosts. As a host itself does

not act as a router (in a host only configuration), there is no need to send redirects.

Rationale:

An attacker could use a compromised host to send invalid ICMP redirects to other router

devices in an attempt to corrupt routing and have users access a system set up by the
attacker as opposed to a valid system.


Audit:

Run the following commands and verify output matches:

# sysctl net.ipv4.conf.all.send_redirects
net.ipv4.conf.all.send_redirects = 0
# sysctl net.ipv4.conf.default.send_redirects
net.ipv4.conf.default.send_redirects = 0


Remediation:

Set the following parameters in the /etc/sysctl.conf    file:

net.ipv4.conf.all.send_redirects = 0
net.ipv4.conf.default.send_redirects = 0
Run the following commands to set the active kernel parameters:


# sysctl -w net.ipv4.conf.default.send_redirects=0
# sysctl -w net.ipv4.route.flush=1












                                                                               126 | P a g e3.2 Network Parameters (Host and Router)


The following network parameters are intended for use on both host only and router
systems. A system acts as a router if it has at least two interfaces and is configured to

perform routing functions.

3.2.1 Ensure source routed packets are not accepted (Scored)


Profile Applicability:

 Level 1 - Server

 Level 1 - Workstation


Description:

In networking, source routing allows a sender to partially or fully specify the route packets
take through a network. In contrast, non-source routed packets travel a path determined

by routers in the network. In some cases, systems may not be routable or reachable from
some locations (e.g. private addresses vs. Internet routable), and so source routed packets
would need to be used.


Rationale:

Settingnet.ipv4.conf.all.accept_source_route       and
net.ipv4.conf.default.accept_source_route        to 0 disables the system from accepting

source routed packets. Assume this system was capable of routing packets to Internet
routable addresses on one interface and private addresses on another interface. Assume
that the private addresses were not routable to the Internet routable addresses and vice

versa. Under normal routing circumstances, an attacker from the Internet routable
addresses could not use the system as a way to reach the private address systems. If,

however, source routed packets were allowed, they could be used to gain access to the
private address systems as the route could be specified, rather than rely on routing
protocols that did not allow this routing.

Profile Applicability:


 Level 1 - Server

 Level 1 - Workstation


Description:

ICMP redirect messages are packets that convey routing information and tell your host

(acting as a router) to send packets via an alternate path. It is a way of allowing an outside
routing device to update your system routing tables. By setting

net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_redirects       to 0, the system will not accept any ICMP redirect
messages, and therefore, won't allow outsiders to update the system's routing tables.


Rationale:

Attackers could use bogus ICMP redirect messages to maliciously alter the system routing
tables and get them to send packets to incorrect networks and allow your system packets

to be captured.

Description:

Secure ICMP redirects are the same as ICMP redirects, except they come from gateways

listed on the default gateway list. It is assumed that these gateways are known to your
system, and that they are likely to be secure.


Rationale:

It is still possible for even known gateways to be compromised. Setting

net.ipv4.conf.all.secure_redirects       to 0 protects the system from routing table
updates by possibly compromised known gateways.

Profile Applicability:

 Level 1 - Server


 Level 1 - Workstation

Description:


Setting net.ipv4.icmp_echo_ignore_broadcasts       to 1 will cause the system to ignore all
ICMP echo and timestamp requests to broadcast and multicast addresses.

Rationale:


Accepting ICMP echo and timestamp requests with broadcast or multicast destinations for
your network could be used to trick your host into starting (or participating) in a Smurf

attack. A Smurf attack relies on an attacker sending large amounts of ICMP broadcast
messages with a spoofed source address. All hosts receiving this message and responding
would send echo-reply messages back to the spoofed address, which is probably not

routable. If many hosts respond to the packets, the amount of traffic on the network could
be significantly multiplied.

Profile Applicability:


 Level 1 - Server

 Level 1 - Workstation


Description:

Setting icmp_ignore_bogus_error_responses      to 1 prevents the kernel from logging bogus
responses (RFC-1122 non-compliant) from broadcast reframes, keeping file systems from

filling up with useless log messages.

Rationale:


Some routers (and some attackers) will send responses that violate RFC-1122 and attempt
to fill up a log file system with many useless error messages.

Profile Applicability:


 Level 1 - Server

 Level 1 - Workstation


Description:

Setting net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter     and  net.ipv4.conf.default.rp_filter      to 1

forces the Linux kernel to utilize reverse path filtering on a received packet to determine if
the packet was valid. Essentially, with reverse path filtering, if the return packet does not

go out the same interface that the corresponding source packet came from, the packet is
dropped (and logged if log_martians    is set).


Rationale:

Setting these flags is a good way to deter attackers from sending your system bogus
packets that cannot be responded to. One instance where this feature breaks down is if

asymmetrical routing is employed. This would occur when using dynamic routing protocols
(bgp, ospf, etc) on your system. If you are using asymmetrical routing on your system, you

will not be able to enable this feature without breaking the routing.

Profile Applicability:

 Level 1 - Server


 Level 1 - Workstation

Description:


When  tcp_syncookies    is set, the kernel will handle TCP SYN packets normally until the
half-open connection queue is full, at which time, the SYN cookie functionality kicks in. SYN
cookies work by not using the SYN queue at all. Instead, the kernel simply replies to the

SYN with a SYN|ACK, but will include a specially crafted TCP sequence number that
encodes the source and destination IP address and port number and the time the packet

was sent. A legitimate connection would send the ACK packet of the three way handshake
with the specially crafted sequence number. This allows the system to verify that it has
received a valid response to a SYN cookie and allow the connection, even though there is no

corresponding SYN in the queue.

Rationale:


Attackers use SYN flood attacks to perform a denial of service attacked on a system by
sending many SYN packets without completing the three way handshake. This will quickly
use up slots in the kernel's half-open connection queue and prevent legitimate connections

from succeeding. SYN cookies allow the system to keep accepting valid connections, even if
under a denial of service attack.

Description:


TCP Wrappers provides a simple access list and standardized logging method for services
capable of supporting it. In the past, services that were calledinetd  and xinetd
supported the use of tcp wrappers. Asinetd  and xinetd  have been falling in disuse, any

service that can support tcp wrappers will have thlibwrap.so  library attached to it.

Rationale:

TCP Wrappers provide a good simple access list mechanism to services that may not have

that support built in. It is recommended that all services that can support TCP Wrappers,
use it.


Audit:

Run the following command and verify TCP Wrappers is installed:

should be applied to the IP6tables as well.




Note: This section broadly assumes starting with an empty IPtables firewall ruleset
(established by flushing the rules withiptables -F  ). Remediation steps included only

affect the live system, you will also need to configure your default firewall configuration to

apply on boot. Configuration of a live systems firewall directly over a remote connection
will often result in being locked out. It is advised to have a known good firewall

configuration set to run on boot and to configure an entire firewall structure in a script that
is then run and tested before saving to boot. The following script will implement the

firewall rules of this section and open port 22(ssh) from anywhere:

#!/bin/bash

# Flush IPtables rules
iptables -F

# Ensure default deny firewall policy
iptables -P OUTPUT DROP
iptables -P FORWARD DROP

# Ensure loopback traffic is configured
iptables -A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT
iptables -A OUTPUT -o lo -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -s 127.0.0.0/8 -j DROP

# Ensure outbound and established connections are configured
iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp -m state --state NEW,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
iptables -A OUTPUT -p udp -m state --state NEW,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
iptables -A OUTPUT -p icmp -m state --state NEW,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -m state --state ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT

iptables -A INPUT -p icmp -m state --state ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT

# Open inbound ssh(tcp port 22) connections
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -m state --state NEW -j ACCEPT



Ubuntu is distributed with the UFW service which acts as a front end to iptables. The
default configuration of UFW implements a configuration very similar to that

recommended here. IPTables configuration allows for far more complex implementations


                                                                               148 | P a g ethan those listed here which may satisfy the intent of these recommendations without

3.6.1 Ensure iptables is installed (Scored)


Profile Applicability:

 Level 1 - Server


 Level 1 - Workstation

Description:

iptables  allows configuration of the IPv4 tables in the linux kernel and the rules stored

within them. Most firewall configuration utilities operate as a front end to iptables .

Rationale:


iptables is required for firewall management and configuration.

Audit:

Run the following command and verify iptables is installed:

# dpkg -s iptables


Remediation:

Run the following command to install   iptables  :

# apt-get install iptables




















                                                                                 149 | P a g e3.6.2 Ensure default deny firewall policy (Scored)

Profile Applicability:


 Level 1 - Server

 Level 1 - Workstation


Description:

A default deny all policy on connections ensures that any unconfigured network usage will

be rejected.

Rationale:

With a default accept policy the firewall will accept any packet that is not configured to be

denied. It is easier to white list acceptable usage than to black list unacceptable usage.

Audit:


Run the following command and verify that the policy for the  INPUT ,OUTPUT , and FORWARD
chains isDROP  orREJECT :

# iptables -L
Chain INPUT (policy DROP)
Chain FORWARD (policy DROP)
Chain OUTPUT (policy DROP)


Remediation:

Run the following commands to implement a default DROP policy:

# iptables -P INPUT DROP
# iptables -P OUTPUT DROP
# iptables -P FORWARD DROP

Notes:


Changing firewall settings while connected over network can result in being locked out of
the system.


Remediation will only affect the active system firewall, be sure to configure the default
policy in your firewall management to apply on boot as well.

Profile Applicability:

 Level 1 - Server


 Level 1 - Workstation


Description:

Configure the loopback interface to accept traffic. Configure all other interfaces to deny

traffic to the loopback network (127.0.0.0/8).


Rationale:

Loopback traffic is generated between processes on machine and is typically critical to

operation of the system. The loopback interface is the only place that loopback network
(127.0.0.0/8) traffic should be seen, all other interfaces should ignore traffic on this

network as an anti-spoofing measure.


Audit:

Run the following commands and verify output includes the listed rules in order (packet

and byte counts may differ):

# iptables -L INPUT -v -n
Chain INPUT (policy DROP 0 packets, 0 bytes)
 pkts bytes target      prot opt in      out     source                destination
    0      0 ACCEPT     all  --   lo     *       0.0.0.0/0             0.0.0.0/0
    0      0 DROP       all  --   *      *       127.0.0.0/8           0.0.0.0/0

 # iptables -L OUTPUT -v -n
Chain OUTPUT (policy DROP 0 packets, 0 bytes)
 pkts bytes target      prot opt in      out     source                destination
    0      0 ACCEPT     all  --   *      lo      0.0.0.0/0             0.0.0.0/0




Remediation:

Run the following commands to implement the loopback rules:


# iptables -A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT
# iptables -A OUTPUT -o lo -j ACCEPT
# iptables -A INPUT -s 127.0.0.0/8 -j DROP

Scored)

Profile Applicability:


 Level 1 - Server

 Level 1 - Workstation

Description:


Configure the firewall rules for new outbound, and established connections.

Rationale:

If rules are not in place for new outbound, and established connections all packets will be

dropped by the default policy preventing network usage.

Audit:

Run the following command and verify all rules for new outbound, and established

connections match site policy:

# iptables -L -v -n

Remediation:


Configure iptables in accordance with site policy. The following commands will implement
a policy to allow all outbound connections and all established connections:

# iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp -m state --state NEW,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
# iptables -A OUTPUT -p udp -m state --state NEW,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
# iptables -A OUTPUT -p icmp -m state --state NEW,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
# iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -m state --state ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
# iptables -A INPUT -p udp -m state --state ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT

Profile Applicability:

 Level 1 - Server


 Level 1 - Workstation


Description:


Any ports that have been opened on non-loopback addresses need firewall rules to govern
traffic.


Rationale:


Without a firewall rule configured for open ports default firewall policy will drop all
packets to these ports.


Audit:


Run the following command to determine open ports:




# netstat -ln
Active Internet connections (only servers)
Proto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address             Foreign Address          State
tcp         0      0 0.0.0.0:22               0.0.0.0:*                LISTEN



Run the following command to determine firewall rules:




# iptables -L INPUT -v -n
Chain INPUT (policy DROP 0 packets, 0 bytes)
 pkts bytes target      prot opt in      out     source                destination
    0      0 ACCEPT     all  --   lo     *       0.0.0.0/0             0.0.0.0/0
    0      0 DROP       all  --   *      *       127.0.0.0/8           0.0.0.0/0

tcp dpt:22 state NEW
Verify all open ports listening on non-localhost addresses have at least one firewall rule.


The last line identified by the "tcp dpt:22 state NEW" identifies it as a firewall rule for new

connections on tcp port 22.

Remediation:





                                                                              154 | P a g eFor each port identified in the audit which does not have a firewall rule establish a proper
rule for accepting inbound connections:

# iptables -A INPUT -p <protocol> --dport <port> -m state --state NEW -j ACCEPT


Notes:

Changing firewall settings while connected over network can result in being locked out of
the system.


Remediation will only affect the active system firewall, be sure to configure the default
policy in your firewall management to apply on boot as well.

The remediation command opens up the port to traffic from all sources. Consult iptables

documentation and set any restrictions in compliance with site policy.

Profile Applicability:

 Level 1 - Server


 Level 2 - Workstation

Description:

Wireless networking is used when wired networks are unavailable. Ubuntu contains a

wireless tool kit to allow system administrators to configure and use wireless networks.

Rationale:

If wireless is not to be used, wireless devices can be disabled to reduce the potential attack

surface.

Audit:

Run the following command to determine wireless interfaces on the system:


# iwconfig
Run the following command and verify wireless interfaces are active:

# ip link show up

Remediation:


Run the following command to disable any wireless interfaces:

# ip link set <interface> down
Disable any wireless interfaces in your network configuration.

Impact:


Many if not all laptop workstations and some desktop workstations will connect via
wireless requiring these interfaces be enabled.


4 Logging and Auditing

The items in this section describe how to configure logging, log monitoring, and auditing,

using tools included in most distributions.

It is recommended that rsyslog  be used for logging (withlogwatch  providing
summarization) and  auditd  be used for auditing (witaureport  providing

                                                                            156 | P a g esummarization) to automatically monitor logs for intrusion attempts and other suspicious
system behavior.


In addition to the local log files created by the steps in this section, it is also recommended
that sites collect copies of their system logs on a secure, centralized log server via an
encrypted connection. Not only does centralized logging help sites correlate events that

may be occurring on multiple systems, but having a second copy of the system log
information may be critical after a system compromise where the attacker has modified the
local log files on the affected system(s). If a log correlation system is deployed, configure it

to process the logs described in this section.

Because it is often necessary to correlate log information from many different systems
(particularly after a security incident) it is recommended that the time be synchronized

among systems and devices connected to the local network. The standard Internet protocol
for time synchronization is the Network Time Protocol (NTP), which is supported by most

network-ready devices. See the  ntpd(8)  manual page for more information on configuring
NTP.

It is important that all logs described in this section be monitored on a regular basis and

correlated to determine trends. A seemingly innocuous entry in one log could be more
significant when compared to an entry in another log.

Note on log file permissions: There really isn't a "one size fits all" solution to the
permissions on log files. Many sites utilize group permissions so that administrators who

are in a defined security group, such as "wheel" do not have to elevate privileges to root in
order to read log files. Also, if a third party log aggregation tool is used, it may need to have

group permissions to read the log files, which is preferable to having it run setuid to root.
Therefore, there are two remediation and audit steps for log file permissions. One is for
systems that do not have a secured group method implemented that only permits root to

read the log filesroot:root 600   ). The other is for sites that do have such a setup and are
designated as root:securegrp 640     where  securegrp   is the defined security group (in
some cases  wheel ).


4.1 Configure System Accounting (auditd)


System auditing, through  auditd , allows system administrators to monitor their systems
such that they can detect unauthorized access or modification of data. By default, auditd
will audit SELinux AVC denials, system logins, account modifications, and authentication

events. Events will be logged to/var/log/audit/audit.log     . The recording of these events
will use a modest amount of disk space on a system. If significantly more events are

captured, additional on system or off system storage may need to be allocated.


                                                                                157 | P a g eThe recommendations in this section implement an audit policy that produces large
quantities of logged data. In some environments it can be challenging to store or process
these logs and as such they are marked as Level 2 for both Servers and Workstations.


Note: For 64 bit systems that have arch as a rule parameter, you will need two rules: one

for 64 bit and one for 32 bit systems. For 32 bit systems, only one rule is needed.



Note: Once all configuration changes have been made to     /etc/audit/audit.rules    , the

auditd configuration must be reloaded:

# service auditd reload






































                                                                                  158 | P a g e4.1.1 Configure Data Retention


When auditing, it is important to carefully configure the storage requirements for audit
logs. By default, auditd will max out the log files at 5MB and retain only 4 copies of them.
Older versions will be deleted. It is possible on a system that the 20 MBs of audit logs may

fill up the system causing loss of audit data. While the recommendations here provide
guidance, check your site policy for audit storage requirements.


4.1.1.1 Ensure audit log storage size is configured (Not Scored)

Profile Applicability:

 Level 2 - Server


 Level 2 - Workstation

Description:

Configure the maximum size of the audit log file. Once the log reaches the maximum size, it

will be rotated and a new log file will be started.

Rationale:

It is important that an appropriate size is determined for log files so that they do not impact
the system and audit data is not lost.


Audit:

Run the following command and ensure output is in compliance with site policy:

# grep max_log_file /etc/audit/auditd.conf
max_log_file = <MB>

Remediation:

Set the following parameter in /etc/audit/auditd.conf    in accordance with site policy:

max_log_file = <MB>


Notes:

The max_log_file parameter is measured in megabytes.





                                                                              159 | P a g e4.1.1.2 Ensure system is disabled when audit logs are full (Scored)


Profile Applicability:

 Level 2 - Server


 Level 2 - Workstation

Description:


The auditd  daemon can be configured to halt the system when the audit logs are full.

Rationale:


In high security contexts, the risk of detecting unauthorized access or nonrepudiation
exceeds the benefit of the system's availability.


Audit:

Run the following commands and verify output matches:


space_left_action = email/etc/audit/auditd.conf
# grep action_mail_acct /etc/audit/auditd.conf
action_mail_acct = root
# grep admin_space_left_action /etc/audit/auditd.conf
admin_space_left_action = halt


Remediation:

Set the following parameters in/etc/audit/auditd.conf:

space_left_action = email
action_mail_acct = root
admin_space_left_action = halt



















                                                                             160 | P a g e4.1.1.3 Ensure audit logs are not automatically deleted (Scored)


Profile Applicability:

 Level 2 - Server


 Level 2 - Workstation

Description:


The max_log_file_action    setting determines how to handle the audit log file reaching the
max file size. A value okeep_logs will rotate the logs but never delete old logs.

Rationale:


In high security contexts, the benefits of maintaining a long audit history exceed the cost of
storing the audit history.


Audit:

Run the following command and verify output matches:

# grep max_log_file_action /etc/audit/auditd.conf
max_log_file_action = keep_logs

Remediation:


Set the following parameter in/etc/audit/auditd.conf:

max_log_file_action = keep_logs




















                                                                             161 | P a g e4.1.2 Ensure auditd service is enabled (Scored)


Profile Applicability:

 Level 2 - Server


 Level 2 - Workstation

Description:


Turn on the auditd  daemon to record system events.

Rationale:

The capturing of system events provides system administrators with information to allow

them to determine if unauthorized access to their system is occurring.

Audit:

Run the following command to verify  auditd  is enabled:


enabledmctl is-enabled auditd

Verify result is "enabled".

Remediation:


Run the following command to enable   auditd :

# systemctl enable auditd




















                                                                              162 | P a g e4.1.3 Ensure auditing for processes that start prior to auditd is enabled

(Scored)


Profile Applicability:

 Level 2 - Server


 Level 2 - Workstation

Description:


Configure grub so that processes that are capable of being audited can be audited even if
they start up prior tauditd  startup.

Rationale:


Audit events need to be captured on processes that start up prior tauditd , so that
potential malicious activity cannot go undetected.


Audit:

Run the following command and verify that each linux line has theaudit=1  parameter set:

# grep "^\s*linux" /boot/grub/grub.cfg

Remediation:


Edit /etc/default/grub   and add audit=1 to GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX:

GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="audit=1"
Run the following command to update the   grub2 configuration:

# update-grub


Notes:

This recommendation is designed around the grub bootloader, if LILO or another
bootloader is in use in your environment enact equivalent settings.

clock_settime   (allows for the setting of several internal clocks and timers) system calls

have been executed and always write an audit record to the /var/log/audit.log    file upon
exit, tagging the records with the identifier "time-change"


Rationale:

Unexpected changes in system date and/or time could be a sign of malicious activity on the
system.


Audit:

On a 32 bit system run the following command and verify the output matches:

(Scored)


Profile Applicability:

 Level 2 - Server


 Level 2 - Workstation

Description:


Record events affecting the group,passwd   (user IDs),shadow  and gshadow  (passwords) or
/etc/security/opasswd     (old passwords, based on remember parameter in the PAM
configuration) files. The parameters in this section will watch the files to see if they have

been opened for write or have had attribute changes (e.g. permissions) and tag them with
the identifier "identity" in the audit log file.


Rationale:

Unexpected changes to these files could be an indication that the system has been

compromised and that an unauthorized user is attempting to hide their activities or
compromise additional accounts.


Audit:

Run the following command and verify output matches:

# grep identity /etc/audit/audit.rules
-w /etc/group -p wa -k identity
-w /etc/passwd -p wa -k identity
-w /etc/gshadow -p wa -k identity
-w /etc/shadow -p wa -k identity

collected (Scored)

Profile Applicability:


 Level 2 - Server

 Level 2 - Workstation


Description:

Record changes to network environment files or system calls. The below parameters

monitor the sethostname (set the systems host name) or setdomainname (set the systems
domainname) system calls, and write an audit event on system call exit. The other

parameters monitor the  /etc/issue   and /etc/issue.net   files (messages displayed pre-
login),/etc/hosts  (file containing host names and associated IP addresses) and
/etc/sysconfig/network    (directory containing network interface scripts and

configurations) files.

Rationale:


Monitoring  sethostname  and setdomainname    will identify potential unauthorized changes
to host and domainname of a system. The changing of these names could potentially break

security parameters that are set based on those names. The /etc/hosts  file is monitored
for changes in the file that can indicate an unauthorized intruder is trying to change

machine associations with IP addresses and trick users and processes into connecting to
unintended machines. Monitoring   /etc/issue  and /etc/issue.net    is important, as

intruders could put disinformation into those files and trick users into providing
information to the intruder. Monitoring/etc/sysconfig/network     is important as it can

show if network interfaces or scripts are being modified in a way that can lead to the
machine becoming unavailable or compromised. All audit records will be tagged with the
identifier "system-locale."


Audit:

Description:

Monitor SELinux/AppArmor mandatory access controls. The parameters below monitor
any write access (potential additional, deletion or modification of files in the directory) or

attribute changes to the /etc/selinux or /etc/apparmor and /etc/apparmor.d directories.

Rationale:

Changes to files in these directories could indicate that an unauthorized user is attempting

to modify access controls and change security contexts, leading to a compromise of the
system.


Audit:

On systems using SELinux run the following command and verify output matches:

# grep MAC-policy /etc/audit/audit.rules
-w /etc/selinux/ -p wa -k MAC-policy



On systems using AppArmor run the following command and verify output matches:

# grep MAC-policy /etc/audit/audit.rules
-w /etc/apparmor/ -p wa -k MAC-policy

Description:

Monitor login and logout events. The parameters below track changes to files associated

with login/logout events. The file/var/log/faillog    tracks failed events from login. The
file/var/log/lastlog    maintain records of the last time a user successfully logged in. The

file/var/log/tallylog   maintains records of failures via thepam_tally2   module

Rationale:

Monitoring login/logout events could provide a system administrator with information

associated with brute force attacks against user logins.

Profile Applicability:

 Level 2 - Server


 Level 2 - Workstation

Description:

Monitor session initiation events. The parameters in this section track changes to the files

associated with session events. The fil/var/run/utmp   file tracks all currently logged in
users. The /var/log/wtmp   file tracks logins, logouts, shutdown, and reboot events. All

audit records will be tagged with the identifier "session." The /var/log/btmp    keeps
track of failed login attempts and can be read by entering the command /usr/bin/last -f

/var/log/btmp  . All audit records will be tagged with the identifier "logins."


Rationale:

Monitoring these files for changes could alert a system administrator to logins occurring at
unusual hours, which could indicate intruder activity (i.e. a user logging in at a time when

they do not normally log in).

Audit:


Run the following command and verify output matches:

# grep session /etc/audit/audit.rules

Description:


Monitor changes to file permissions, attributes, ownership and group. The parameters in
this section track changes for system calls that affect file permissions and attributes. The

chmod ,fchmod   and fchmodat  system calls affect the permissions associated with a file. The
chown ,fchown ,fchownat   and  lchown  system calls affect owner and group attributes on a

file. Thesetxattr  ,lsetxattr , fsetxattr   (set extended file attributes) andremovexattr   ,
lremovexattr   ,fremovexattr   (remove extended file attributes) control extended file

attributes. In all cases, an audit record will only be written for non-system user ids (auid >=
1000) and will ignore Daemon events (auid = 4294967295). All audit records will be

tagged with the identifier "perm_mod."


Rationale:

Monitoring for changes in file attributes could alert a system administrator to activity that
could indicate intruder activity or policy violation.

 Level 2 - Workstation

Description:


Monitor for unsuccessful attempts to access files. The parameters below are associated
with system calls that control creation creat ), opening (open ,openat ) and truncation

(truncate , ftruncate ) of files. An audit log record will only be written if the user is a non-
privileged user (auid > = 1000), is not a Daemon event (auid=4294967295) and if the

system call returned EACCES (permission denied to the file) or EPERM (some other
permanent error associated with the specific system call). All audit records will be tagged

with the identifier "access."

Rationale:


Failed attempts to open, create or truncate files could be an indication that an individual or
process is trying to gain unauthorized access to the system.

Profile Applicability:

 Level 2 - Server


 Level 2 - Workstation

Description:


Monitor privileged programs (those that have the setuid and/or setgid bit set on execution)
to determine if unprivileged users are running these commands.

Rationale:


Execution of privileged commands by non-privileged users could be an indication of
someone trying to gain unauthorized access to the system.


Audit:

Run the following command replacing <partition> with a list of partitions where programs
can be executed from on your system:

# find <partition> -xdev \( -perm -4000 -o -perm -2000 \) -type f | awk '{print \
"-a always,exit -F path=" $1 " -F perm=x -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=4294967295 \
-k privileged" }'
Verify all resulting lines are in /etc/audit/audit.rules     file.


Remediation:

To remediate this issue, the system administrator will have to execute a find command to

locate all the privileged programs and then add an audit line for each one of them. The
audit parameters associated with this are as follows:

-F path=" $1 "   - will populate each file name found through the find command and

processed by awk.
-F perm=x  - will write an audit record if the file is executed.

-F auid>=1000   - will write a record if the user executing the command is not a privileged
user.
-F auid!= 4294967295    - will ignore Daemon events


All audit records should be tagged with the identifier "privileged".




                                                                               176 | P a g eRun the following command replacing <partition> with a list of partitions where programs

Profile Applicability:


 Level 2 - Server

 Level 2 - Workstation


Description:

Monitor the use of themount  system call. The mount  (and umount ) system call controls the
mounting and unmounting of file systems. The parameters below configure the system to

create an audit record when the mount system call is used by a non-privileged user

Rationale:


It is highly unusual for a non privileged user mount  file systems to the system. While
tracking mount commands gives the system administrator evidence that external media

may have been mounted (based on a review of the source of the mount and confirming it's
an external media type), it does not conclusively indicate that data was exported to the
media. System administrators who wish to determine if data were exported, would also

have to track successfulopen ,creat  and truncate   system calls requiring write access to a
file under the mount point of the external media file system. This could give a fair

indication that a write occurred. The only way to truly prove it, would be to track
successful writes to the external media. Tracking write system calls could quickly fill up the

audit log and is not recommended. Recommendations on configuration options to track
data export to media is beyond the scope of this document.


Audit:

On a 32 bit system run the following command and verify the output matches:

# grep mounts /etc/audit/audit.rules
-a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S mount -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=4294967295 -k mounts

Notes:

This tracks successful and unsuccessful mount commands. File system mounts do not have

to come from external media and this action still does not verify write (e.g. CD ROMS).

unlinkat   (remove a file attribute)rename  (rename a file) and renameat  (rename a file
attribute) system calls and tags them with the identifier "delete".


Rationale:

Monitoring these calls from non-privileged users could provide a system administrator
with evidence that inappropriate removal of files and file attributes associated with

protected files is occurring. While this audit option will look at all events, system
administrators will want to look for specific privileged files that are being deleted or

altered.

Monitor the sudo  log file. If the system has been properly configured to disable the use of
the su command and force all administrators to have to log in first and then ussudo to

execute privileged commands, then all administrator commands will be logged to
/var/log/sudo.log  . Any time a command is executed, an audit event will be triggered as

the /var/log/sudo.log   file will be opened for write and the executed administration
command will be written to the log.


Rationale:

Changes in /var/log/sudo.log    indicate that an administrator has executed a command or
the log file itself has been tampered with. Administrators will want to correlate the events

written to the audit trail with the records written/var/log/sudo.log    to verify if
unauthorized commands have been executed.


Audit:

Run the following command and verify output matches:

# grep actions /etc/audit/audit.rules
-w /var/log/sudo.log -p wa -k actions

Remediation:


Add the following lines to th/etc/audit/audit.rules     file:

-w /var/log/sudo.log -p wa -k actions

Notes:


The system must be configured with  su disabled (See Item 5.6 Ensure access to the su
command is restricted) to force all command execution through  sudo. This will not be

effective on the console, as administrators can log in as root.


                                                                             183 | P a g e4.1.17 Ensure kernel module loading and unloading is collected (Scored)


Profile Applicability:

 Level 2 - Server


 Level 2 - Workstation

Description:


Monitor the loading and unloading of kernel modules. The programs  insmod  (install a
kernel module), rmmod  (remove a kernel module), and  modprobe  (a more sophisticated

program to load and unload modules, as well as some other features) control loading and
unloading of modules. The init_module   (load a module) and delete_module   (delete a

module) system calls control loading and unloading of modules. Any execution of the
loading and unloading module programs and system calls will trigger an audit record with
an identifier of "modules".


Rationale:

Monitoring the use ofinsmod ,rmmod  and modprobe   could provide system administrators

with evidence that an unauthorized user loaded or unloaded a kernel module, possibly
compromising the security of the system. Monitoring of theinit_module   and

delete_module   system calls would reflect an unauthorized user attempting to use a
different program to load and unload modules.


Audit:

On a 32 bit system run the following command and verify the output matches:

# grep modules /etc/audit/audit.rules
-w /sbin/insmod -p x -k modules
-w /sbin/rmmod -p x -k modules
-w /sbin/modprobe -p x -k modules
-a always,exit arch=b32 -S init_module -S delete_module -k modules



On a 64 bit system run the following command and verify the output matches:

Profile Applicability:

 Level 2 - Server

 Level 2 - Workstation


Description:

Set system audit so that audit rules cannot be modified withauditctl . Setting the flag "-e
2" forces audit to be put in immutable mode. Audit changes can only be made on system

reboot.

Rationale:

In immutable mode, unauthorized users cannot execute changes to the audit system to

potentially hide malicious activity and then put the audit rules back. Users would most
likely notice a system reboot and that could alert administrators of an attempt to make
unauthorized audit changes.


Audit:

Run the following command and verify output matches:

Logging services should be configured to prevent information leaks and to aggregate logs
on a remote server so that they can be reviewed in the event of a system compromise and
ease log analysis.

Rationale:

Storing log data on a remote host protects log integrity from local attacks. If an attacker
gains root access on the local system, they could tamper with or remove log data that is

stored on the local system

Audit:

Profile Applicability:

 Level 1 - Server

 Level 1 - Workstation


Description:

By default,rsyslog  does not listen for log messages coming in from remote systems. The

ModLoad  tellsrsyslog  to load theimtcp.so   module so it can listen over a network via
TCP. The InputTCPServerRun    option instructsrsyslogd   to listen on the specified TCP

port.

Rationale:


The guidance in the section ensures that remote log hosts are configured to only accept
rsyslog  data from hosts within the specified domain and that those systems that are not

designed to be log hosts do not accept any remote rsyslog  messages. This provides
protection from spoofed log data and ensures that system administrators are reviewing
reasonably complete syslog data in a central location.


Audit:

Run the following commands and verify the resulting lines are uncommented on

designated log hosts and commented or removed on all others:

# grep '$ModLoad imtcp.so' /etc/rsyslog.conf

5.1.1 Ensure cron daemon is enabled (Scored)

Profile Applicability:


 Level 1 - Server

 Level 1 - Workstation

Description:


The cron  daemon is used to execute batch jobs on the system.

Rationale:

While there may not be user jobs that need to be run on the system, the system does have

maintenance jobs that may include security monitoring that have to run, andcron is used
to execute them.


Audit:

Run the following command to verify cron  is enabled:

# systemctl is-enabled crond
enabled
Verify result is "enabled".


Remediation:

Run the following command to enable  cron :

# systemctl enable crond














                                                                            204 | P a g e5.1.2 Ensure permissions on /etc/crontab are configured (Scored)


Profile Applicability:

 Level 1 - Server


 Level 1 - Workstation

Description:

The /etc/crontab   file is used bcron  to control its own jobs. The commands in this item

make sure that root is the user and group owner of the file and that only the owner can
access the file.


Rationale:

This file contains information on what system jobs are run by cron. Write access to these

files could provide unprivileged users with the ability to elevate their privileges. Read
access to these files could provide users with the ability to gain insight on system jobs that

run on the system and could provide them a way to gain unauthorized privileged access.

Audit:


Run the following command and verify  Uid and  Gid are both0/root  and Access does not
grant permissions to group or other:

# stat /etc/crontab
Access: (0600/-rw-------)   Uid: (    0/    root)    Gid: (    0/    root)

Description:

Configure /etc/cron.allow   and /etc/at.allow   to allow specific users to use these

services. I/etc/cron.allow   or/etc/at.allow   do not exist, the/etc/at.deny   and
/etc/cron.deny   are checked. Any user not specifically defined in those files is allowed to

use at and cron. By removing the files, only users/etc/cron.allow   and /etc/at.allow

are allowed to use at and cron. Note that even though a given user is not listed in
cron.allow , cron jobs can still be run as that user.cron.allow  file only controls

administrative access to the crontab command for scheduling and modifying cron jobs.

Rationale:


On many systems, only the system administrator is authorized to schedulecron  jobs. Using
the cron.allow  file to control who can rucron  jobs enforces this policy. It is easier to

manage an allow list than a deny list. In a deny list, you could potentially add a user ID to
the system and forget to add it to the deny files.


Audit:


Run the following commands and ensure   /etc/cron.deny  and /etc/at.deny  do not exist:

# stat /etc/cron.deny

SSH is a secure, encrypted replacement for common login services such as telnet ,ftp ,

rlogin ,rsh, and rcp. It is strongly recommended that sites abandon older clear-text login
protocols and use SSH to prevent session hijacking and sniffing of sensitive data off the

network.



Note: The recommendations in this section only apply if the SSH daemon is installed on the

system, if remote access is not required the SSH daemon can be removed and this section
skipped.




Note: Once all configuration changes have been made to  /etc/ssh/sshd_config   , the sshd
configuration must be reloaded:

# service sshd reload

Profile Applicability:

 Level 1 - Server


 Level 1 - Workstation

Description:

SSH supports two different and incompatible protocols: SSH1 and SSH2. SSH1 was the

original protocol and was subject to security issues. SSH2 is more advanced and secure.

Rationale:

SSH v1 suffers from insecurities that do not affect SSH v2.


Audit:

Run the following command and verify that output matches:

# grep "^Protocol" /etc/ssh/sshd_config
Protocol 2

Remediation:

Edit the/etc/ssh/sshd_config     file to set the parameter as follows:

Profile Applicability:

 Level 1 - Server


 Level 1 - Workstation

Description:


The INFO  parameter specifies that login and logout activity will be logged.

Rationale:

SSH provides several logging levels with varying amounts of verbosity. DEBUG  is specifically

not recommended other than strictly for debugging SSH communications since it provides
so much data that it is difficult to identify important security informatINFO  level is the

basic level that only records login activity of SSH users. In many situations, such as Incident
Response, it is important to determine when a particular user was active on a system. The
logout record can eliminate those users who disconnected, which helps narrow the field.


Audit:

Run the following command and verify that output matches:

# grep "^LogLevel" /etc/ssh/sshd_config
LogLevel INFO

Profile Applicability:

 Level 1 - Server


 Level 1 - Workstation

Description:

The X11Forwarding parameter provides the ability to tunnel X11 traffic through the

connection to enable remote graphic connections.

Rationale:

Disable X11 forwarding unless there is an operational requirement to use X11 applications

directly. There is a small risk that the remote X11 servers of users who are logged in via
SSH with X11 forwarding could be compromised by other users on the X11 server. Note
that even if X11 forwarding is disabled, users can always install their own forwarders.


Audit:

Run the following command and verify that output matches:

# grep "^X11Forwarding" /etc/ssh/sshd_config
X11Forwarding no

Profile Applicability:


 Level 1 - Server

 Level 1 - Workstation


Description:

The MaxAuthTries   parameter specifies the maximum number of authentication attempts
permitted per connection. When the login failure count reaches half the number, error

messages will be written to thesyslog  file detailing the login failure.

Rationale:


Setting theMaxAuthTries   parameter to a low number will minimize the risk of successful
brute force attacks to the SSH server. While the recommended setting is 4, set the number
based on site policy.


Audit:

Run the following command and verify that output  MaxAuthTries   is 4 or less:

# grep "^MaxAuthTries" /etc/ssh/sshd_config

Profile Applicability:


 Level 1 - Server

 Level 1 - Workstation


Description:

The HostbasedAuthentication      parameter specifies if authentication is allowed through
trusted hosts via the user o.rhosts  , o/etc/hosts.equiv   , along with successful public

key client host authentication. This option only applies to SSH Protocol Version 2.

Rationale:


Even though the  .rhosts  files are ineffective if support is disabled/etc/pam.conf  ,
disabling the ability to us.rhosts  files in SSH provides an additional layer of protection .


Audit:

Run the following command and verify that output matches:

Profile Applicability:

 Level 1 - Server


 Level 1 - Workstation

Description:


The PermitRootLogin    parameter specifies if the root user can log in using ssh(1). The
default is no.

Rationale:


Disallowing root logins over SSH requires system admins to authenticate using their own
individual account, then escalating to root vsudo  or su. This in turn limits opportunity

for non-repudiation and provides a clear audit trail in the event of a security incident

Audit:

Run the following command and verify that output matches:

Description:


The PermitEmptyPasswords    parameter specifies if the SSH server allows login to accounts
with empty password strings.

Rationale:


Disallowing remote shell access to accounts that have an empty password reduces the
probability of unauthorized access to the system


Audit:

Run the following command and verify that output matches:

# grep "^PermitEmptyPasswords" /etc/ssh/sshd_config
PermitEmptyPasswords no

Remediation:

Edit the/etc/ssh/sshd_config    file to set the parameter as follows:

Description:

The PermitUserEnvironment    option allows users to present environment options to the
ssh  daemon.


Rationale:

Permitting users the ability to set environment variables through the SSH daemon could

potentially allow users to bypass security controls (e.g. setting an execution path that has
ssh  executing trojan'd programs)


Audit:

Run the following command and verify that output matches:

Profile Applicability:

 Level 1 - Server


 Level 1 - Workstation

Description:


This variable limits the types of MAC algorithms that SSH can use during communication.

Rationale:

MD5 and 96-bit MAC algorithms are considered weak and have been shown to increase

exploitability in SSH downgrade attacks. Weak algorithms continue to have a great deal of
attention as a weak spot that can be exploited with expanded computing power. An
attacker that breaks the algorithm could take advantage of a MiTM position to decrypt the

SSH tunnel and capture credentials and information

Audit:


Run the following command and verify that output does not contain any unlisted MAC
algorithms:

# grep "MACs" /etc/ssh/sshd_config
MACs hmac-sha2-512-etm@openssh.com,hmac-sha2-256-etm@openssh.com,umac-128-

Profile Applicability:

 Level 1 - Server

 Level 1 - Workstation


Description:

The two options  ClientAliveInterval    and ClientAliveCountMax     control the timeout of

ssh sessions. When the ClientAliveInterval     variable is set, ssh sessions that have no
activity for the specified length of time are terminated. When thClientAliveCountMax

variable is setsshd  will send client alive messages at everClientAliveInterval
interval. When the number of consecutive client alive messages are sent with no response

from the client, thssh  session is terminated. For example, if thClientAliveInterval    is
set to 15 seconds and the ClientAliveCountMax    is set to 3, the clissh  session will be

terminated after 45 seconds of idle time.

Rationale:

Having no timeout value associated with a connection could allow an unauthorized user

access to another user'sssh  session (e.g. user walks away from their computer and doesn't
lock the screen). Setting a timeout value at least reduces the risk of this happening..


While the recommended setting is 300 seconds (5 minutes), set this timeout value based on
site policy. The recommended setting for ClientAliveCountMax    is 0. In this case, the client

session will be terminated after 5 minutes of idle time and no keepalive messages will be
sent.


Audit:

Profile Applicability:

 Level 1 - Server


 Level 1 - Workstation

Description:


The LoginGraceTime    parameter specifies the time allowed for successful authentication to
the SSH server. The longer the Grace period is the more open unauthenticated connections
can exist. Like other session controls in this session the Grace Period should be limited to

appropriate organizational limits to ensure the service is available for needed access.

Rationale:


Setting theLoginGraceTime   parameter to a low number will minimize the risk of
successful brute force attacks to the SSH server. It will also limit the number of concurrent
unauthenticated connections While the recommended setting is 60 seconds (1 Minute), set

the number based on site policy.

Audit:


Run the following command and verify that output  LoginGraceTime   is 60 or less:

# grep "^LoginGraceTime" /etc/ssh/sshd_config
LoginGraceTime 60

Remediation:

Edit the/etc/ssh/sshd_config     file to set the parameter as follows:

Profile Applicability:


 Level 1 - Server

 Level 1 - Workstation


Description:

There are several options available to limit which users and group can access the system
via SSH. It is recommended that at least one of the following options be leveraged:

AllowUsers


The AllowUsers   variable gives the system administrator the option of allowing specific
users tossh  into the system. The list consists of comma separated user names. Numeric

user IDs are not recognized with this variable. If a system administrator wants to restrict
user access further by only allowing the allowed users to log in from a particular host, the
entry can be specified in the form of user@host.

AllowGroups


The AllowGroups   variable gives the system administrator the option of allowing specific
groups of users tossh into the system. The list consists of comma separated group names.

Numeric group IDs are not recognized with this variable.

DenyUsers

The DenyUsers   variable gives the system administrator the option of denying specific
users tossh  into the system. The list consists of comma separated user names. Numeric

user IDs are not recognized with this variable. If a system administrator wants to restrict
user access further by specifically denying a user's access from a particular host, the entry

can be specified in the form of user@host.

DenyGroups

The DenyGroups   variable gives the system administrator the option of denying specific

groups of users tossh into the system. The list consists of comma separated group names.
Numeric group IDs are not recognized with this variable.


Rationale:

Restricting which users can remotely access the system via SSH will help ensure that only
authorized users access the system.

                                                                            229 | P a g eAudit:

Description:


The Banner  parameter specifies a file whose contents must be sent to the remote user
before authentication is permitted. By default, no banner is displayed.

Rationale:


Banners are used to warn connecting users of the particular site's policy regarding
connection. Presenting a warning message prior to the normal user login may assist the

prosecution of trespassers on the computer system.

PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules) is a service that implements modular
authentication modules on UNIX systems. PAM is implemented as a set of shared objects
that are loaded and executed when a program needs to authenticate a user. Files for PAM

are typically located in th/etc/pam.d  directory. PAM must be carefully configured to
secure system authentication. While this section covers some of PAM, please consult other

PAM resources to fully understand the configuration capabilities.


5.3.1 Ensure password creation requirements are configured (Scored)

Profile Applicability:


 Level 1 - Server

 Level 1 - Workstation


Description:

The pam_pwquality.so    module checks the strength of passwords. It performs checks such
as making sure a password is not a dictionary word, it is a certain length, contains a mix of

characters (e.g. alphabet, numeric, other) and more. The following are definitions of
the pam_pwquality.so   options.


      try_first_pass   - retrieve the password from a previous stacked PAM module. If
       not available, then prompt the user for a password.

      retry=3  - Allow 3 tries before sending back a failure.

The following options are set in the/etc/security/pwquality.conf     file:


      minlen=14   - password must be 14 characters or more
      dcredit=-1   - provide at least one digit

      ucredit=-1   - provide at least one uppercase character
      ocredit=-1   - provide at least one special character
      lcredit=-1   - provide at least one lowercase character




The settings shown above are one possible policy. Alter these values to conform to your
own organization's password policies.


Rationale:


                                                                               232 | P a g eStrong passwords protect systems from being hacked through brute force methods.

Remediation:


Run the following command to install the pam_pwquality module:

apt-get install libpam-pwquality

Edit the/etc/pam.d/common-passwd     file to include the appropriate options
forpam_pwquality.so    and to conform to site policy:

Scored)


Profile Applicability:

 Level 1 - Server


 Level 1 - Workstation

Description:

Lock out users after n unsuccessful consecutive login attempts. The first sets of changes are

made to the PAM configuration files. The second set of changes are applied to the program
specific PAM configuration file. The second set of changes must be applied to each program
that will lock out users. Check the documentation for each secondary program for

instructions on how to configure them to work with PAM.

Set the lockout number to the policy in effect at your site.


Rationale:

Locking out user IDs after n unsuccessful consecutive login attempts mitigates brute force
password attacks against your systems.


Audit:

Perform the following to determine the current settings for user lockout.

# grep "pam_tally2" /etc/pam.d/common-auth
auth required pam_tally2.so onerr=fail audit silent deny=5 unlock_time=900

Remediation:

Edit the/etc/pam.d/common-auth     file and add the auth line below:

auth required pam_tally2.so onerr=fail audit silent deny=5 unlock_time=900

Note: If a user has been locked out because they have reached the maximum consecutive
failure count defined bydeny= in thepam_tally2.so   module, the user can be unlocked by

issuing the command  /sbin/pam_tally2 -u    <username>   --reset . This command sets the
failed count to 0, effectively unlocking the user.

Profile Applicability:


 Level 1 - Server

 Level 1 - Workstation

Description:


The /etc/security/opasswd     file stores the users' old passwords and can be checked to
ensure that users are not recycling recent passwords.


Rationale:

Forcing users not to reuse their past 5 passwords make it less likely that an attacker will be
able to guess the password.


Note that these change only apply to accounts configured on the local system.

Audit:

Run the following commands and ensure the    remember option is 5' or more and included in

all results:

# egrep '^password\s+sufficient\s+pam_unix.so' /etc/pam.d/common-password

Profile Applicability:


 Level 1 - Server

 Level 1 - Workstation

Description:


The commands below change password encryption from      md5  tosha512  (a much stronger
hashing algorithm). All existing accounts will need to perform a password change to

upgrade the stored hashes to the new algorithm.

Rationale:

The SHA-512 algorithm provides much stronger hashing than MD5, thus providing

additional protection to the system by increasing the level of effort for an attacker to
successfully determine passwords.

Note that these change only apply to accounts configured on the local system.


Audit:

Run the following commands and ensure the sha512 option is included in all results:

# egrep '^password\s+\S+\s+pam_unix.so' /etc/pam.d/common-password
password sufficient pam_unix.so sha512

Remediation:


Edit the/etc/pam.d/common-password     file to include tsha512 option for pam_unix.so  as
shown:

password [success=1 default=ignore] pam_unix.so sha512


Notes:

Additional module options may be set, recommendation only covers those listed here.

If it is determined that the password algorithm being used is not SHA-512, once it is

changed, it is recommended that all user ID's be immediately expired and forced to change
their passwords on next login. To accomplish that, the following commands can be used.
Any system accounts that need to be expired should be carefully done separately by the

system administrator to prevent any potential problems.


                                                                             236 | P a g e# cat /etc/passwd | awk -F: '( $3 >= 1000 && $1 != "nfsnobody" ) { print $1 }' | xargs

While a majority of the password control parameters have been moved to PAM, some

parameters are still available through the shadow password suite. Any changes made to
/etc/login.defs   will only be applied if thusermod  command is used. If user IDs are

added a different way, use thechage  command to effect changes to individual user IDs.

5.4.1.1 Ensure password expiration is 90 days or less (Scored)


Profile Applicability:


 Level 1 - Server

 Level 1 - Workstation

Description:


The PASS_MAX_DAYS   parameter in  /etc/login.defs   allows an administrator to force
passwords to expire once they reach a defined age. It is recommended that the

PASS_MAX_DAYS   parameter be set to less than or equal to 90 days.

Rationale:

The window of opportunity for an attacker to leverage compromised credentials or

successfully compromise credentials via an online brute force attack is limited by the age of
the password. Therefore, reducing the maximum age of a password also reduces an

attacker's window of opportunity.

Audit:


Run the following command and verify  PASS_MAX_DAYS   is 90 or less:

# grep PASS_MAX_DAYS /etc/login.defs
PASS_MAX_DAYS 90
Verify all users with a password have their maximum days between password change set
to 90 or less:


<list of users>[^\!*] /etc/shadow | cut -d: -f1
# chage --list <user>
Maximum number of days between password change            : 90


Remediation:

Set thePASS_MAX_DAYS   parameter to 90 in/etc/login.defs  :


                                                                             238 | P a g ePASS_MAX_DAYS 90

Modify user parameters for all users with a password set to match:

# chage --maxdays 90 <user>

Notes:


You can also check this setting in/etc/shadow   directly. The 5th field should be 90 or less
for all users with a password.

(Scored)


Profile Applicability:

 Level 1 - Server


 Level 1 - Workstation

Description:


The PASS_MIN_DAYS   parameter in /etc/login.defs    allows an administrator to prevent
users from changing their password until a minimum number of days have passed since the

last time the user changed their password. It is recommended thatPASS_MIN_DAYS
parameter be set to 7 or more days.


Rationale:

By restricting the frequency of password changes, an administrator can prevent users from
repeatedly changing their password in an attempt to circumvent password reuse controls.


Audit:

Run the following command and verify  PASS_MIN_DAYS  is 7 or more:


# grep PASS_MIN_DAYS /etc/login.defs
PASS_MIN_DAYS 7
Verify all users with a password have their minimum days between password change set to
7 or more:


# egrep ^[^:]+:[^\!*] /etc/shadow | cut -d: -f1
# chage --list <user>
Minimum number of days between password change           : 7


Remediation:

Profile Applicability:

 Level 1 - Server


 Level 1 - Workstation

Description:


The PASS_WARN_AGE   parameter in  /etc/login.defs   allows an administrator to notify users
that their password will expire in a defined number of days. It is recommended that the

PASS_WARN_AGE   parameter be set to 7 or more days.

Rationale:

Providing an advance warning that a password will be expiring gives users time to think of

a secure password. Users caught unaware may choose a simple password or write it down
where it may be discovered.


Audit:

Run the following command and verify   PASS_WARN_AGE  is 7 or more:


PASS_WARN_AGE 7N_AGE /etc/login.defs

Verify all users with a password have their number of days of warning before password
expires set to 7 or more:


<list of users>[^\!*] /etc/shadow | cut -d: -f1
# chage --list <user>
Number of days of warning before password expires         : 7


Remediation:

Set thePASS_WARN_AGE   parameter to 7 in /etc/login.defs  :

PASS_WARN_AGE 7

Modify user parameters for all users with a password set to match:

# chage --warndays 7 <user>

Notes:


You can also check this setting i/etc/shadow  directly. The 6th field should be 7 or more
for all users with a password.


                                                                              242 | P a g e5.4.1.4 Ensure inactive password lock is 30 days or less (Scored)


Profile Applicability:

 Level 1 - Server

 Level 1 - Workstation


Description:

User accounts that have been inactive for over a given period of time can be automatically

disabled. It is recommended that accounts that are inactive for 30 days after password
expiration be disabled.


Rationale:

Inactive accounts pose a threat to system security since the users are not logging in to
notice failed login attempts or other anomalies.


Audit:

Run the following command and verify   INACTIVE  is 30 or less:


INACTIVE=35D | grep INACTIVE

Verify all users with a password have Password inactive no more than 30 days after
password expires:

# egrep ^[^:]+:[^\!*] /etc/shadow | cut -d: -f1

# chage --list <user>
Password inactive                                          : <date>


Remediation:

Run the following command to set the default password inactivity period to 30 days:

# useradd -D -f 30
Modify user parameters for all users with a password set to match:


# chage --inactive 30 <user>

Notes:

You can also check this setting i/etc/shadow   directly. The 7th field should be 30 or less

for all users with a password.

Profile Applicability:

 Level 1 - Server


 Level 1 - Workstation

Description:


There are a number of accounts provided with Ubuntu that are used to manage
applications and are not intended to provide an interactive shell.


Rationale:

It is important to make sure that accounts that are not being used by regular users are

prevented from being used to provide an interactive shell. By default, Ubuntu sets the
password field for these accounts to an invalid string, but it is also recommended that the

shell field in the password file be set /sbin/nologin  . This prevents the account from
potentially being used to run any commands.


Audit:

Run the following script and verify no results are returned:


$1!="halt" && $3<1000 && $7!="/usr/sbin/nologin" && $7!="/bin/false") {print}'wn" &&


Remediation:

Set the shell for any accounts returned by the audit script t/usr/sbin/nologin   :


# usermod -s /usr/sbin/nologin <user>
The following script will automatically set all user shells required /usr/sbin/nologin

and lock the sync ,shutdown , andhalt  users:

Description:


The usermod command can be used to specify which group the root user belongs to. This
affects permissions of files that are created by the root user.

Rationale:


Using GID 0 for the root account helps prevent root-owned files from accidentally
becoming accessible to non-privileged users.


Audit:

Run the following command and verify the result is  0:

# grep "^root:" /etc/passwd | cut -f4 -d:

Profile Applicability:


 Level 1 - Server

 Level 1 - Workstation


Description:

The default umask  determines the permissions of files created by users. The user creating

the file has the discretion of making their files and directories readable by others via the
chmod command. Users who wish to allow their files and directories to be readable by

others by default may choose a different default umask by inserting theumask  command
into the standard shell configuration file.profile ,.bashrc , etc.) in their home
directories.


Rationale:

Setting a very secure default value foumask  ensures that users make a conscious choice

about their file permissions. A defaulumask setting of077  causes files and directories
created by users to not be readable by any other user on the system. Aumask  of027  would

make files and directories readable by users in the same Unix group, while umask  of 022
would make files readable by every user on the system.


Audit:

Run the following commands and verify all umask lines returned are 027 or more

restrictive.

# grep "^umask" /etc/bash.bashrc
umask 027
umask 027umask" /etc/profile


Remediation:

Edit the/etc/bash.bashrc   and /etc/profile    files (and the appropriate files for any other

shell supported on your system) and add or edit any umask parameters as follows:

umask 027

Notes:




                                                                              246 | P a g eThe audit and remediation in this recommendation apply to bash and shell. If other shells
are supported on the system, it is recommended that their configuration files also are

checked.

Other methods of setting a default user umask exist however the shell configuration files
are the last run and will override other settings if they exist therefore our recommendation

is to configure in the shell configuration files. If other methods are in use in your
environment they should be audited and the shell configs should be verified to not
override.

pam_wheel.so   statement in /etc/pam.d/su  , thsu  command will only allow users in the
wheel group to execute su .


Rationale:

Restricting the use osu, and usingsudo  in its place, provides system administrators better

control of the escalation of user privileges to execute privileged commands. The sudo utility
also provides a better logging and audit mechanism, as it can log each command executed
viasudo , whereas su can only record that a user executed thesu program.


Audit:

Run the following command and verify output includes matching line:

# grep pam_wheel.so /etc/pam.d/su
auth required pam_wheel.so use_uid

Run the following command and verify users in  wheel group match site policy:

# grep wheel /etc/group
wheel:x:10:root,<user list>

Remediation:


Add the following line to th/etc/pam.d/su   file:

auth required pam_wheel.so use_uid
Create a comma separated list of users in the wheel statement in th/etc/group   file:

wheel:x:10:root,<user list>

This section provides guidance on securing aspects of system files and directories.


6.1.1 Audit system file permissions (Not Scored)


Profile Applicability:


 Level 2 - Server

 Level 2 - Workstation


Description:

The Debian package manager has a number of useful options. One of these, the --

verify option, can be used to verify that system packages are correctly installed. --e
verify option can be used to verify a particular package or to verify all system packages. If

no output is returned, the package is installed correctly. The following table describes the
meaning of output from the verify option:


Code   Meaning
S      File size differs.
M      File mode differs (includes permissions and file type).
5      The MD5 checksum differs.
D      The major and minor version numbers differ on a device file.
U      The file ownership differs..
G      The file group owner differs.
T      The file time (mtime) differs.

The dpkg -S  command can be used to determine which package a particular file belongs to.
For example the following commands determines which package the     /bin/bash  file

belongs to:

# dpkg -S /bin/bash
bash: /bin/bash

To verify the settings for the package that controls /bin/bash   file, run the following:

# dpkg --verify bash
??5?????? c /etc/bash.bashrc


Rationale:

It is important to confirm that packaged system files and directories are maintained with

the permissions they were intended to have from the OS vendor.

Audit:




                                                                             251 | P a g eRun the following command to review all installed packages. Note that this may be very
time consuming and may be best scheduled via the   cron  utility. It is recommended that the

output of this command be redirected to a file that can be reviewed later.

# dpkg --verify > <filename>

Remediation:

Correct any discrepancies found and rerun the audit until output is clean or risk is

mitigated or accepted.

    1. http://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-

       US/Fedora_Draft_Documentation/0.1/html/RPM_Guide/index.html

Notes:

Since packages and important files may change with new updates and releases, it is

recommended to verify everything, not just a finite list of files. This can be a time
consuming task and results may depend on site policy therefore it is not a scorable
benchmark item, but is provided for those interested in additional security measures.


Some of the recommendations of this benchmark alter the state of files audited by this
recommendation. The audit command will alert for all changes to a file permissions even if
the new state is more secure than the default.

Profile Applicability:

 Level 1 - Server


 Level 1 - Workstation

Description:


The /etc/passwd   file contains user account information that is used by many system
utilities and therefore must be readable for these utilities to operate.


Rationale:

It is critical to ensure that /etc/passwd  file is protected from unauthorized write

access. Although it is protected by default, the file permissions could be changed either
inadvertently or through malicious actions.


Audit:

Run the following command and verify   Uid and Gid are both 0/root and Access  is644 :


# stat /etc/passwd
Access: (0644/-rw-r--r--)   Uid: (     0/    root)   Gid: (     0/    root)

Remediation:

Run the following command to set permissions on   /etc/passwd  :


# chown root:root /etc/passwd
# chmod 644 /etc/passwd




















                                                                              253 | P a g e6.1.3 Ensure permissions on /etc/shadow are configured (Scored)


Profile Applicability:

 Level 1 - Server


 Level 1 - Workstation

Description:


The /etc/shadow    file is used to store the information about user accounts that is critical to
the security of those accounts, such as the hashed password and other security

information.

Rationale:


If attackers can gain read access to th/etc/shadow    file, they can easily run a password
cracking program against the hashed password to break it. Other security information that

is stored in the/etc/shadow   file (such as expiration) could also be useful to subvert the
user accounts.


Audit:

Run the following command and verify    Uid is0/root ,Gid is <gid>/shadow  , andAccess  is

640 or more restrictive:

# stat /etc/shadow
Access: (0640/-rw-r-----)    Uid: (     0/    root)   Gid: (    42/  shadow)


Remediation:

Run the one following commands to set permissions on    /etc/shadow   :

# chown root:shadow /etc/shadow
# chmod o-rwx,g-wx /etc/shadow















                                                                                254 | P a g e6.1.4 Ensure permissions on /etc/group are configured (Scored)


Profile Applicability:

 Level 1 - Server


 Level 1 - Workstation

Description:


The /etc/group   file contains a list of all the valid groups defined in the system. The
command below allows read/write access for root and read access for everyone else.


Rationale:

The /etc/group   file needs to be protected from unauthorized changes by non-privileged

users, but needs to be readable as this information is used with many non-privileged
programs.


Audit:

Run the following command and verify  Uid and Gid are both 0/root and Access  is644:


Access: (0644/-rw-r--r--)   Uid: (    0/    root)   Gid: (    0/     root)


Remediation:

Run the following command to set permissions on  /etc/group :


# chown root:root /etc/group
# chmod 644 /etc/group



















                                                                            255 | P a g e6.1.5 Ensure permissions on /etc/gshadow are configured (Scored)


Profile Applicability:

 Level 1 - Server


 Level 1 - Workstation

Description:


The /etc/gshadow   file is used to store the information about groups that is critical to the
security of those accounts, such as the hashed password and other security information.


Rationale:

If attackers can gain read access to th/etc/gshadow   file, they can easily run a password

cracking program against the hashed password to break it. Other security information that
is stored in th/etc/gshadow   file (such as group administrators) could also be useful to

subvert the group.

Audit:


Run the following command and
verify verifyUid is0/root, Gid  is<gid>/shadow,   and Access  is640 or more restrictive:


Access: (0640/-rw-r-----)   Uid: (     0/    root)    Gid: (   42/  shadow)


Remediation:

Run the following commands to set permissions on   /etc/gshadow  :


# chown root:shadow /etc/gshadow
# chmod o-rwx,g-rw /etc/gshadow
















                                                                              256 | P a g e6.1.6 Ensure permissions on /etc/passwd- are configured (Scored)


Profile Applicability:

Description:


The /etc/passwd-   file contains backup user account information.

Rationale:


It is critical to ensure that/etc/passwd-   file is protected from unauthorized access.
Although it is protected by default, the file permissions could be changed either

inadvertently or through malicious actions.

Audit:


Run the following command and verify  Uid and  Gid are both0/root  and Access is600 or
more restrictive:


Access: (0600/-rw-------)   Uid: (    0/    root)    Gid: (    0/    root)

Profile Applicability:

 Level 1 - Server


 Level 1 - Workstation

Description:


Unix-based systems support variable settings to control access to files. World writable files
are the least secure. See thchmod(2)  man page for more information.

Rationale:


Data in world-writable files can be modified and compromised by any user on the system.
World writable files may also indicate an incorrectly written script or program that could

potentially be the cause of a larger compromise to the system's integrity.

Audit:

Run the following command and verify no files are returned:

# df --local -P | awk {'if (NR!=1) print $6'} | xargs -I '{}' find '{}' -xdev -type f
-perm -0002

The command above only searches local filesystems, there may still be compromised items
on network mounted partitions. Additionally the  --local  option to dfis not universal to
all versions, it can be omitted to search all filesystems on a system including network

mounted filesystems or the following command can be run manually for each partition:

# find <partition> -xdev -type f -perm -0002



Remediation:

Removing write access for the "other" category (chmod o-w   <filename>) is advisable, but
always consult relevant vendor documentation to avoid breaking any application

dependencies on a given file.









                                                                              261 | P a g e6.1.11 Ensure no unowned files or directories exist (Scored)


Profile Applicability:

 Level 1 - Server


 Level 1 - Workstation

Description:

Sometimes when administrators delete users from the password file they neglect to
remove all files owned by those users from the system.


Rationale:

A new user who is assigned the deleted user's user ID or group ID may then end up
"owning" these files, and thus have more access on the system than was intended.


Audit:

Run the following command and verify no files are returned:

# df --local -P | awk {'if (NR!=1) print $6'} | xargs -I '{}' find '{}' -xdev -nouser
The command above only searches local filesystems, there may still be compromised items

Remediation:

Locate files that are owned by users or groups not listed in the system configuration files,
and reset the ownership of these files to some active user on the system as appropriate.
















                                                                              262 | P a g e6.1.12 Ensure no ungrouped files or directories exist (Scored)

Profile Applicability:

 Level 1 - Server


 Level 1 - Workstation

Description:

The owner of a file can set the file's permissions to run with the owner's or group's

permissions, even if the user running the program is not the owner or a member of the
group. The most common reason for a SUID program is to enable users to perform

functions (such as changing their password) that require root privileges.

Rationale:

There are valid reasons for SUID programs, but it is important to identify and review such

programs to ensure they are legitimate.

Audit:

Run the following command to list SUID files:

# df --local -P | awk {'if (NR!=1) print $6'} | xargs -I '{}' find '{}' -xdev -type f
-perm -4000

The command above only searches local filesystems, there may still be compromised items
on network mounted partitions. Additionally the  --local  option to dfis not universal to
all versions, it can be omitted to search all filesystems on a system including network

mounted filesystems or the following command can be run manually for each partition:

# find <partition> -xdev -type f -perm -4000

Remediation:

Ensure that no rogue SUID programs have been introduced into the system. Review the

files returned by the action in the Audit section and confirm the integrity of these binaries.











                                                                              264 | P a g e6.1.14 Audit SGID executables (Not Scored)


Profile Applicability:

 Level 1 - Workstation

Description:

The owner of a file can set the file's permissions to run with the owner's or group's

permissions, even if the user running the program is not the owner or a member of the
group. The most common reason for a SGID program is to enable users to perform

functions (such as changing their password) that require root privileges.

Rationale:

There are valid reasons for SGID programs, but it is important to identify and review such

programs to ensure they are legitimate. Review the files returned by the action in the audit
section and check to see if system binaries have a different md5 checksum than what from
the package. This is an indication that the binary may have been replaced.


Audit:

Run the following command to list SGID files:

# df --local -P | awk {'if (NR!=1) print $6'} | xargs -I '{}' find '{}' -xdev -type f

This section provides guidance on securing aspects of the users and groups.

6.2.1 Ensure password fields are not empty (Scored)


Profile Applicability:

 Level 1 - Server

 Level 1 - Workstation


Description:

An account with an empty password field means that anybody may log in as that user
without providing a password.


Rationale:

All accounts must have passwords or be locked to prevent the account from being used by
an unauthorized user.


Audit:

Run the following command and verify that no output is returned:

# cat /etc/shadow | awk -F: '($2 == "" ) { print $1 " does not have a password "}'

Remediation:

If any accounts in th/etc/shadow   file do not have a password, run the following

command to lock the account until it can be determined why it does not have a password:

# passwd -l <username>
Also, check to see if the account is logged in and investigate what it is being used for to
determine if it needs to be forced off.













                                                                             266 | P a g e6.2.2 Ensure no legacy "+" entries exist in /etc/passwd (Scored)

Profile Applicability:


 Level 1 - Server

 Level 1 - Workstation

Description:


Any account with UID 0 has superuser privileges on the system.

Rationale:

This access must be limited to only the defaulroot account and only from the system

console. Administrative access must be through an unprivileged account using an approved
mechanism as noted in Item 5.6 Ensure access to the su command is restricted.

Description:

The root  user can execute any command on the system and could be fooled into executing

programs unintentionally if thePATH  is not set correctly.


Rationale:

Including the current working directory (.) or other writable directory root 's executable

Profile Applicability:


 Level 1 - Server

 Level 1 - Workstation


Description:

Users can be defined in /etc/passwd  without a home directory or with a home directory
that does not actually exist.


Rationale:

If the user's home directory does not exist or is unassigned, the user will be placed in "/"

and will not be able to write any files or have local environment variables set.

Audit:

Run the following script and verify no results are returned:


#!/bin/bash
cat /etc/passwd | awk -F: '{ print $1 " " $3 " " $6 }' | while read user uid dir; do
  if [ $uid -ge 1000 -a ! -d "$dir" -a $user != "nfsnobody" ]; then
    echo "The home directory ($dir) of user $user does not exist."
  fi
done

Remediation:


If any users' home directories do not exist, create them and make sure the respective user
owns the directory. Users without an assigned home directory should be removed or

assigned a home directory as appropriate.

Profile Applicability:


 Level 1 - Server

 Level 1 - Workstation


Description:

While the system administrator can establish secure permissions for users' home

directories, the users can easily override these.

Rationale:


Group or world-writable user home directories may enable malicious users to steal or
modify other users' data or to gain another user's system privileges.

Profile Applicability:

 Level 1 - Server

 Level 1 - Workstation


Description:

The user home directory is space defined for the particular user to set local environment

variables and to store personal files.

Rationale:


Since the user is accountable for files stored in the user home directory, the user must be
the owner of the directory.


Audit:

Run the following script and verify no results are returned:

Description:

The .forward   file specifies an email address to forward the user's mail to.


Rationale:

Use of the.forward   file poses a security risk in that sensitive data may be inadvertently

transferred outside the organization. The.forward   file also poses a risk as it can be used
to execute commands that may perform unintended actions.

Profile Applicability:

 Level 1 - Server

 Level 1 - Workstation


Description:

The .netrc  file contains data for logging into a remote host for file transfers via FTP.


Rationale:

The .netrc  file presents a significant security risk since it stores passwords in

unencrypted form. Even if FTP is disabled, user accounts may have brought over .netrc
files from other systems which could pose a risk to those systems.

 Level 1 - Workstation

Description:


Although the useradd   program will not let you create a duplicate user name, it is possible
for an administrator to manually edit the/etc/passwd   file and change the user name.


Rationale:

If a user is assigned a duplicate user name, it will create and have access to files with the
first UID for that username in/etc/passwd  . For example, if "test4" has a UID of 1000 and a

subsequent "test4" entry has a UID of 2000, logging in as "test4" will use UID 1000.
Effectively, the UID is shared, which is a security problem.

 Level 1 - Workstation

Description:

The shadow group allows system programs which require access the ability to read the

/etc/shadow file. No users should be assigned to the shadow group.

Rationale:

Any users assigned to the shadow group would be granted read access to the /etc/shadow

file. If attackers can gain read access to /etc/shadow   file, they can easily run a
password cracking program against the hashed passwords to break them. Other security

information that is stored in th/etc/shadow   file (such as expiration) could also be useful
to subvert additional user accounts.

Audit:


Run the following commands and verify no results are returned:

# grep ^shadow:[^:]*:[^:]*:[^:]+ /etc/group
# awk -F: '($4 == "<shadow-gid>") { print }' /etc/passwd

Remediation:

Remove all users from the shadow group, and change the primary group of any users with

shadow as their primary group.
